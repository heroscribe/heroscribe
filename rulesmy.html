<h1>Hero Quest</h1>
<h2>RULES OF PLAY</h2>
<h2>The Board</h2>
<p>The board consists of <em>squares</em> that are grouped into different <em>areas</em>. <em>Rooms</em> are areas limited by <em>walls</em> (the white lines). <em>Passages</em> are the areas around and between the rooms. There are 4 outer passages around the edge of the board, 4 inner passages around the central room, and 4 traverse passages connecting the inner and outer passages. Passages are limited by walls, the edge of the board or junctions. <em>Junctions</em> are squares that belong to 2 passages, like the 4 corners of the board.</p>

<h2>Revealing an Area</h2>
<p>Areas are either covered or revealed. At the beginning of the game all areas are covered. When an area is revealed, Zargon places all items shown for that area in the map, except secret items. Zargon places items <em>inside</em> the area, like monsters and furniture, and items on the <em>boundaries</em> of the area, like doors and blocked square tiles. Once revealed, an area stays revealed until the end of the game.</p>
<p>An area is revealed when:
<ul>
<li>an open door is placed on the boundaries of the area</li>
<li>a figure controlled by a character player is about to enter the area</li>
</ul>
The former happens when a character player opens a door, or when Zargon or one of his monsters opens a door if allowed by the quest. The latter happens when a figure wants to step on a junction, is teleported into a covered area, or is able to pass through walls. Zargon interrupts his movement and reveals the room before the figure moves on.
</p>

<h2>The Hero's Turn</h2>
<p>As a hero, when it is your turn you may move and perform an action. Possible actions are:
<ul>
<li>attack</li>
<li>cast a spell</li>
<li>search</li>
<li>special actions described in the quest notes</li>
</ul>
You can move and perform the action in any order.
</p>
<p>If you are in possession of items that allow you to perform actions <em>additionally</em>, you can do so on your turn before or after your movement, or before or after your regular action.</p>
<p>If you are in possession of items that allow you to use them <em>at any time</em>, you can do so even if it is not your turn. If you use such an item or spell on your turn, you can even interrupt your movement and regular action to do so.</p>
<p>If an items tells you to do something <em>immediately</em>, the active player's turn is interrupted until you have done so. If you are the active player and use such an item, this does not influence your ability to perform your regular action this turn.</p>
