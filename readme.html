<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>HeroScribe Online is an HTML and JavaScript online editor for files saved in HeroScribe XML format.
HeroScribe is a powerful editor for HeroQuest maps, but it is discontinued. This site wants
to keep HeroScribe available for everyone and further improve it.</p>
<p>Please also check the original <a href="Readme_HS.html">HeroScribe Readme page</a>.</p>
<p>One important feature of this web version is the easy access to all quests ever published. You can simply navigate through all quests with the links on the main page.</p>
<p>The next strength of HeroScribe Online is its editing capabilities. Create your own quests using only a browser.</p>
<p>The original HeroScribe has vector graphics for high quality prints. HeroScribe Online uses low resolution PNGs to reduce bandwidth. For printing you can load the maps created with HeroScribe Online into HeroScribe.</p>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>Click on the link for a campaign to load all maps of the campaign at once. This might take while. Click on the link of a quest to load a single quest.</p>
<p>You can upload files you have created before by clicking the "Browse" button. You can select several files at once. These maps will be added to the currently loaded campaign.</p>
<h3>A New Beginning</h3>
<p>The campaigns <a href="hq.html?c=ADC&r=EU">Adventure Design Kit EU</a> and <a href="hq.html?c=ADC&r=US">Adventure Design Kit US</a> are no real campaigns. They just offer an empty map
for your design, one map with monsters, furniture, traps etc., and one map with all the big overlay tiles. When you have read the instructions below, you should be able to build your own adventures by copying the elements onto the empty map.</p>
<h3>Editing Quests</h3>
<p>You can edit the quests and save them in HeroScribe XML format to your device by pressing the "Save" button next to each map.</p>
<p>Click on an object in a map to select it. Then click on an empty field to place the object. When you place an object from another map, the object is copied to the new map. The other map is not changed.</p>
<p>In order to delete an object, select it and then press the delete button next to the map.</p>
<p>Click again on a selected object to rotate it.</p>
<p>Tiles spanning multiple fields have their anchor in their top left corner. This means they will rotate around that corner, and when you place them that corner will line up with the field you selected.</p>
<p>You cannot place objects on big overlay tiles like the throne room, but you can put the big tiles under other objects. So setup the room with objects first, then place the big tile underneath.</p>
<p>When you click on an empty field and have no object currently selected, you toggle the "greyed out" property of the field on and off.</p>
<p>You can change the name of the quest by clicking in the text box containing the name and entering a new name.</p>
<p>Please also check the overview page of <a href="Objects.html">available objects</a>.</p>
