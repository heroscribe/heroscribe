<p>The fire burns warmly, but casts little light into Mentor's study.
The flickering shadows only hint at the vast number of books and scrolls
that fill the many shelves. Slowly Mentor walks over to the fire.
<br/>"Well, my friends, your training is complete. You are not yet
Heroes, you have yet to prove yourselves. But first, let me tell you of
Morcar........</p>
<p>"Many centuries ago, Morcar was my apprentice. He worked hard
and learned quickly. But impatience devoured him, and he wanted to learn
more powerful magic. I told him of the dangers, and that he should be
patient, for in time he would become a great wizard. But Morcar could
not wait: each night he broke into my study and read my spell books. The
secrets that were held within them were great indeed. Once he had learnt
these secrets. Morcar fled.</p>
<p>"When I caught up with him, I found him greatly changed. He had
pledged his allegiance to the Great Powers of Chaos. Fool! He saw magic
only as a short-cut to power and paid no heed to the terrible price he
would have to pay. I tried to reason with him, but to no avail. He laughed
in my face and then unleashed a terrible spell which I was hard-pressed to
counter. For many days we battled. but Morcar had allies stronger even
than I, and I could not defeat him. In the end, as we both weakened, he
fled and sought refuge in the Northern Chaos Wastes. There he licked his
wounds and honed his skills, conjuring ancient powers with which to
overthrow the Empire. But he knows not what he has done. They will
serve him while it suits their own dark purposes, but in time they will
destroy him.</p>
<p>"I must watch Morcar and measure the strength of his magic. This
I may do with the help of Loretome. The powers Morcar has called
upon will destroy us all if I relax from this vigil. Morcar's legions have
threatened us once before. Then it was Rogar who aided me and defeated
them. Now they are on the march again: already they have assailed the
Borderlands. The Empire must again look for Heroes and to this end have
I trained you.</p>
<p>"Each of you must complete three tasks. If you do this, you will be
acclaimed as Champions of the Realm and dubbed Imperial Knights.
Then will you truly be on the road to becoming a Hero. I shall
speak with you again on your return - if you return......."</p>
`
outro_gs_eu = `
<p>"You have done well. And yet it seems your task is hardly begun.
Dark clouds gather at the Empire's borders...</p>
<p>"The Emperor rode with his army towards Black Fire Pass, that
perilous mountain route linking the Empire and the Borderlands. No such
army has ever been raised in living memory. Greater even than Rogar's
host it was. They drew up their battle lines on the grassy plains at the
foot of the mountain road and waited. 'Ere nightfall, the sky darkened and
a great wind arose. Spine-chilling shrieks and howls echoed from the
mountain tops. terrifying the horses and filling man and elf alike with
fear.</p>
<p>"Then came the first assault. Pouring down the mountainsive as
though it were a gentle slope rather than an almost vertical cliff, the
hordes of Morcar fell upon the Empire's defenders. Like a black wave they
came: but the lines held and it seemed we should win the day.</p>
<p>"But I had not reckoned with Morcar's magic. He stood high on a
ridge overlooking the battlefield and unleashed his terrible magic.
Lightning flashed from his fingertips and great gouts of flame exploded
among the defenders. Our lines were breached in a dozen places at once and
the enemy howled in delight.</p>
<p>"Then came the Doomguard - Morcar's elite force of Chaos
Knights. Our army broke and ran. Only the Emperor's personal guard held
their ground and many sacrificed themselves to ensure his safe retreat.</p>
<p>"The remnants of the army are now holed up in Karak Varn - the
ancient dwarven stronghold. They do not have provisions for a long siege,
however, so we must act swiftly if we are to save the Emperor and his
army.</p>
<p>"Yet there is another evil to be confronted. The Witch Lord lives.
He too had magic I had not foreseen and was protected from the Spirit
Blade. He was sorely wounded, however, and fled to his ancient retreat in
the Black Mountains. But soon he will have recovered enough to lead the
Legion of the Damned once more.</p>
<p>"The Empire has great need of you. I myself cannot act against
these dangers, for I must move against Morcar and strive to weaken his
power. Until we meet again, take care, my friends. Farewell......."</p>

<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p>Before you can begin to play the adventures
in Kellar’s Keep you must first punch out
the new cardboard components from the die-cut
sheet. Take two of the open doors and remove the
card, but do not throw them away. The new door
pieces should then be folded and fitted into two
door bases as shown.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/assembly_inoutdoor.jpg"></img>
<h3>Playing Kellar’s Keep</h3>
<p>The adventures in Kellar’s Keep are played in the same way as
the adventures in the original game. However, you will notice two
main differences:</p>
<p>Firstly, players do not start the adventures on the stairway tile. Instead,
they enter via a door on the edge of the gameboard, unless instructed
otherwise. The door through which they must enter the gameboard is
shown with a white arrow.</p>
<p>Players may only leave the gameboard by locating either another door on
the edge of the gameboard or the stairway tile.</p>
<p>The Evil Wizard player should use the new door pieces when placing a
door on the edge of the gameboard.</p>
<p>Secondly, as with the last three adventures in the original Quest Book,
the adventures in Kellar’s Keep fit together. You may play several
adventures in a row if you wish. Characters are returned to full strength
and may choose new spells between adventures.</p>
`
intro_kk_eu = `
<p>“Friends, as you know, the Emperor is besieged
in Kellar's Keep. the inner bastion of Karak Varn. The
fortress is well defended, but I fear that time is against
us. The garrison weakens with starvation, while the enemy
grows stronger by the day.</p>
<p>“There is a way in which we can help. The great book
Loretome has revealed a secret passage to me, that has long been
forgotten. It will be your task to find this passage and bring the
Emperor to safety. The passage is known as Grin's Crag and is named
after the Dwarf who first discovered the passage. Grin was a
loner, his life devoted to the search for a rich vein of gold. He never
found one. Yet, whilst searching, he found a narrow footpath running
along the edge of an abyss. He explored beyond and found himself in
the lower caverns of Kellar's Keep, the inner bastion of Karak
Varn (the great Dwarven stronghold that lies within the heart
of the World's Edge Mountains). Grin carved a map onto a stone
tablet so that he might find the path again. This he gave to his
Lord, Belorn.</p>
<p>“The Worlds Edge Mountains stretch along the eastern
edge of the Empire. Many thousands of years ago the Dwarves made
these mountains their home. With their great engineering skills
they built vast cities that cut deep into the rock. The cities were
connected by tunnels that stretched for miles beneath the
mountains. On the eastern side of the mountains the Dwarves
constructed huge fortresses to guard against the Dark Lands.
The greatest of these was Karak Varn.</p>
<p>“The Dwarves lived for many years in peace. for the
Orcs and Goblins did not dare trouble them after their terrible
defeat at Keloth's Tor. But during this time of peace the Dwarves
let their fortresses decline. The garrisons became smaller and
the guards less vigilant. Then came Morcar. He had been patient
and had spent years raising a new army of Orcs and Goblins.
When the attack came there was no warning. The Dwarves
fought with great Valour but their enemies were too many.
One by one the cities fell. Only Karak Varn held.</p>
<p>“You will need to journey through the Halls of Belorn,
ancient passages that lie deep beneath the Worlds Edge Mountains.
The Halls of Belorn are now ruined. They have been stripped
of the riches that once adorned the many passages and chambers.
Only Orcs and Goblins dwell there now. You must make them
pay dearly for their tresspass.</p>
<p>“Even Loretome cannot show exactly where the secret
passage lies. You must find the four pieces of Grin's map, that are
scattered throughout his halls, if you are to locate the path to
Kellar's Keep. You must not fail, for should you do so, our cause
will be lost. I shall take you to the Great Gate, but from there
you will be on your own. Prepare yourselves, for we
leave in the morning.</p>
`
outro_kk_eu = `
<p>The door opened into the darkness of Kellar's Keep.
From far above came the thunder of battle. The forces of
Morcar were making their last, remorseless, assault. This time
there could be no holding them. The Emperor assembled his
captains, determined to organise one last line of defence. Then
came the news: a group of Champions had found a way through
from the Halls of Belorn.</p>
<p>Without hesitation the Emperor ordered his captains
to fall their men back towards Grin's Crag. The guard would take
the rear and fight their way back to the passage, thus giving time
for the rest of the army and the wounded to reach safety. The
guard fought with such strength and courage that the Orcs and
Goblins of Morcar's army fell back. not daring to close with such
a fearsome foe. Morcar looked to his left, then pointed
menancingly towards the Emperor's guard. The Doomguard
stirred from their silence, and moved forward.</p>
<p>The Emperor's guard slowly fell back before them
until the gate was reached. Then it fell to one man to hold the
enemy while the passage behind him was destroyed so that none
could pass. Kenaron, the captain of the guard stood in the gate.
Time and again the heavily clad warriors of the Doomguard
surged forward to be felled by Kanaron’s sword. Morcar
watched for a while, and smiled wryly at Kenaron's courage
and skill-at-arms. A moment later his patience was spent.
Kenaron fell before the storm of flame that burst against the
gate. But it was too late. Morcar's warriors howled in anger,
for the passage was destroyed. The Emperor and the last of his
army had escaped.</p>
<p>“You have done well. The Emperor has asked me to
express his gratitude. Each of you will receive 500 gold coins for
your efforts. But do not let this victory deceive you. A dark
cloud still hangs over the Empire. The army is in need of rest.
Yet the forces of chaos still advance from the East, nothing
stands before them. We are in need of time. I shall look to how
we might delay Morcar's advance. Rest well my friends.</p>
<p>“Once I have consulted Loretome I shall
summon you."</p>
`
intro_rotwl_eu = `
<p>Mentor's head hung low as he entered the room. There
was a sadness in his voice when he spoke.</p>
<p>"Worthy companions, the Witch Lord is not
dead. We must act fast. for his power grows with the
passing of each day. It will not be long before he has
recovered from his imprisonment. Once his power has
fully awoken he will raise again the legions of the dead.
These warriors are a fearsome foe. Only men of great
courage, or those with powerful magic. can stand
against them. They know no fear and will fight
relentlessly until they are destroyed.</p>
"Loretome has shown me that the Witch Lord
has moved from Barak Tor to the fallen city of Kalos.
Long ago the city was destroyed by Morcar and given
to the Witch Lord to rule. Beneath the ruins the
Witch Lord built for himself a great stronghold, for
the light of day was too pure for his foul creatures to
endure. When he was defeated, the stronghold's gates
were shut and no one ventured in or out. Now he has
returned.</p>
<p>"As he sits upon the High throne of Kalos.
the Witch Lord may look upon the Plains of Death
and see any who approach: none can escape his gaze.
The High throne is one of three thrones that wait for
those who would also preside over the Court of the
Dead. If the Witch Lord is not stopped soon, the other
thrones will be taken: one by Skulmar the Captain of
the Dead Host: the other by Kessandria the Witch
Queen. When these two sit alongside the Witch Lord
it is said that the bones of all fallen warriors will be
summoned together under the Black Banner.</p>
<p>"Many days of travel have brought you across
the Plains of Death. The journey has been hard, for
the land here is barren, scorched by the relentless sun.
Throughout your journey you have felt an uneasy
presence. Ever since you entered the Plains, the Witch
Lord has watched your progress, awaiting your arrival.
Finally, you have reached the great ruins. The skeletal
remains of a once resplendent city that rose from rich
and fertile land now lies parched and dust-clogged."</p>
`
outro_rotwl_eu = `
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>"The Witch Lord has been defeated and his
army of the dead remains asleep under the earth. The
magic that animated them has been weakened. Yet this
victory could herald our downfall if we relax our
struggle. Now is the time for our efforts to be
renewed. Now the foe is weaker, our blow must be all
the stronger. The minions of the Witch Lord who
escaped are still active and will surely strive to have
revenge on those who defeated their master. Indeed.
Loretome has shown me that Skulmar, who we believed
to be slain, has escaped from the ruins of Kalos with
many of the Witch Lord's most powerful spell books.
He was aided by the traitorous Sir Ragnar who you
once rescued from the forces of Chaos but who has now
been corrupted by that same influence. I fear that it
will not be long before you will have to confront
Skulmar and attempt to end this threat forever,
although Sir Ragnar has been captured and executed.</p>
<p>"But for the present you have earned yourselves
a rest. So come, my friends, the Emperor awaits you in
the Grand Palace. Tonight you are to be honoured
for your incredible feats of heroism in the presence of
the nobility of the whole Empire."</p>
