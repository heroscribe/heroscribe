<p>The fire burns warmly, but casts little light into Mentor's study.
The flickering shadows only hint at the vast number of books and scrolls
that fill the many shelves. Slowly Mentor walks over to the fire.
<br/>"Well, my friends, your training is complete. You are not yet
Heroes, you have yet to prove yourselves. But first, let me tell you of
Morcar........</p>
<p>"Many centuries ago, Morcar was my apprentice. He worked hard
and learned quickly. But impatience devoured him, and he wanted to learn
more powerful magic. I told him of the dangers, and that he should be
patient, for in time he would become a great wizard. But Morcar could
not wait: each night he broke into my study and read my spell books. The
secrets that were held within them were great indeed. Once he had learnt
these secrets. Morcar fled.</p>
<p>"When I caught up with him, I found him greatly changed. He had
pledged his allegiance to the Great Powers of Chaos. Fool! He saw magic
only as a short-cut to power and paid no heed to the terrible price he
would have to pay. I tried to reason with him, but to no avail. He laughed
in my face and then unleashed a terrible spell which I was hard-pressed to
counter. For many days we battled. but Morcar had allies stronger even
than I, and I could not defeat him. In the end, as we both weakened, he
fled and sought refuge in the Northern Chaos Wastes. There he licked his
wounds and honed his skills, conjuring ancient powers with which to
overthrow the Empire. But he knows not what he has done. They will
serve him while it suits their own dark purposes, but in time they will
destroy him.</p>
<p>"I must watch Morcar and measure the strength of his magic. This
I may do with the help of Loretome. The powers Morcar has called
upon will destroy us all if I relax from this vigil. Morcar's legions have
threatened us once before. Then it was Rogar who aided me and defeated
them. Now they are on the march again: already they have assailed the
Borderlands. The Empire must again look for Heroes and to this end have
I trained you.</p>
<p>"Each of you must complete three tasks. If you do this, you will be
acclaimed as Champions of the Realm and dubbed Imperial Knights.
Then will you truly be on the road to becoming a Hero. I shall
speak with you again on your return - if you return......."</p>
`
outro_gs_eu = `
<p>"You have done well. And yet it seems your task is hardly begun.
Dark clouds gather at the Empire's borders...</p>
<p>"The Emperor rode with his army towards Black Fire Pass, that
perilous mountain route linking the Empire and the Borderlands. No such
army has ever been raised in living memory. Greater even than Rogar's
host it was. They drew up their battle lines on the grassy plains at the
foot of the mountain road and waited. 'Ere nightfall, the sky darkened and
a great wind arose. Spine-chilling shrieks and howls echoed from the
mountain tops. terrifying the horses and filling man and elf alike with
fear.</p>
<p>"Then came the first assault. Pouring down the mountainsive as
though it were a gentle slope rather than an almost vertical cliff, the
hordes of Morcar fell upon the Empire's defenders. Like a black wave they
came: but the lines held and it seemed we should win the day.</p>
<p>"But I had not reckoned with Morcar's magic. He stood high on a
ridge overlooking the battlefield and unleashed his terrible magic.
Lightning flashed from his fingertips and great gouts of flame exploded
among the defenders. Our lines were breached in a dozen places at once and
the enemy howled in delight.</p>
<p>"Then came the Doomguard - Morcar's elite force of Chaos
Knights. Our army broke and ran. Only the Emperor's personal guard held
their ground and many sacrificed themselves to ensure his safe retreat.</p>
<p>"The remnants of the army are now holed up in Karak Varn - the
ancient dwarven stronghold. They do not have provisions for a long siege,
however, so we must act swiftly if we are to save the Emperor and his
army.</p>
<p>"Yet there is another evil to be confronted. The Witch Lord lives.
He too had magic I had not foreseen and was protected from the Spirit
Blade. He was sorely wounded, however, and fled to his ancient retreat in
the Black Mountains. But soon he will have recovered enough to lead the
Legion of the Damned once more.</p>
<p>"The Empire has great need of you. I myself cannot act against
these dangers, for I must move against Morcar and strive to weaken his
power. Until we meet again, take care, my friends. Farewell......."</p>
