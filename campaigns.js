<p>The fire burns warmly, but casts little light into Mentor's study.
The flickering shadows only hint at the vast number of books and scrolls
that fill the many shelves. Slowly Mentor walks over to the fire.
<br/>"Well, my friends, your training is complete. You are not yet
Heroes, you have yet to prove yourselves. But first, let me tell you of
Morcar........</p>
<p>"Many centuries ago, Morcar was my apprentice. He worked hard
and learned quickly. But impatience devoured him, and he wanted to learn
more powerful magic. I told him of the dangers, and that he should be
patient, for in time he would become a great wizard. But Morcar could
not wait: each night he broke into my study and read my spell books. The
secrets that were held within them were great indeed. Once he had learnt
these secrets. Morcar fled.</p>
<p>"When I caught up with him, I found him greatly changed. He had
pledged his allegiance to the Great Powers of Chaos. Fool! He saw magic
only as a short-cut to power and paid no heed to the terrible price he
would have to pay. I tried to reason with him, but to no avail. He laughed
in my face and then unleashed a terrible spell which I was hard-pressed to
counter. For many days we battled. but Morcar had allies stronger even
than I, and I could not defeat him. In the end, as we both weakened, he
fled and sought refuge in the Northern Chaos Wastes. There he licked his
wounds and honed his skills, conjuring ancient powers with which to
overthrow the Empire. But he knows not what he has done. They will
serve him while it suits their own dark purposes, but in time they will
destroy him.</p>
<p>"I must watch Morcar and measure the strength of his magic. This
I may do with the help of Loretome. The powers Morcar has called
upon will destroy us all if I relax from this vigil. Morcar's legions have
threatened us once before. Then it was Rogar who aided me and defeated
them. Now they are on the march again: already they have assailed the
Borderlands. The Empire must again look for Heroes and to this end have
I trained you.</p>
<p>"Each of you must complete three tasks. If you do this, you will be
acclaimed as Champions of the Realm and dubbed Imperial Knights.
Then will you truly be on the road to becoming a Hero. I shall
speak with you again on your return - if you return......."</p>
`
outro_gs_eu = `
<p>"You have done well. And yet it seems your task is hardly begun.
Dark clouds gather at the Empire's borders...</p>
<p>"The Emperor rode with his army towards Black Fire Pass, that
perilous mountain route linking the Empire and the Borderlands. No such
army has ever been raised in living memory. Greater even than Rogar's
host it was. They drew up their battle lines on the grassy plains at the
foot of the mountain road and waited. 'Ere nightfall, the sky darkened and
a great wind arose. Spine-chilling shrieks and howls echoed from the
mountain tops. terrifying the horses and filling man and elf alike with
fear.</p>
<p>"Then came the first assault. Pouring down the mountainsive as
though it were a gentle slope rather than an almost vertical cliff, the
hordes of Morcar fell upon the Empire's defenders. Like a black wave they
came: but the lines held and it seemed we should win the day.</p>
<p>"But I had not reckoned with Morcar's magic. He stood high on a
ridge overlooking the battlefield and unleashed his terrible magic.
Lightning flashed from his fingertips and great gouts of flame exploded
among the defenders. Our lines were breached in a dozen places at once and
the enemy howled in delight.</p>
<p>"Then came the Doomguard - Morcar's elite force of Chaos
Knights. Our army broke and ran. Only the Emperor's personal guard held
their ground and many sacrificed themselves to ensure his safe retreat.</p>
<p>"The remnants of the army are now holed up in Karak Varn - the
ancient dwarven stronghold. They do not have provisions for a long siege,
however, so we must act swiftly if we are to save the Emperor and his
army.</p>
<p>"Yet there is another evil to be confronted. The Witch Lord lives.
He too had magic I had not foreseen and was protected from the Spirit
Blade. He was sorely wounded, however, and fled to his ancient retreat in
the Black Mountains. But soon he will have recovered enough to lead the
Legion of the Damned once more.</p>
<p>"The Empire has great need of you. I myself cannot act against
these dangers, for I must move against Morcar and strive to weaken his
power. Until we meet again, take care, my friends. Farewell......."</p>

<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p>Before you can begin to play the adventures
in Kellar’s Keep you must first punch out
the new cardboard components from the die-cut
sheet. Take two of the open doors and remove the
card, but do not throw them away. The new door
pieces should then be folded and fitted into two
door bases as shown.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/assembly_inoutdoor.jpg"></img>
<h3>Playing Kellar’s Keep</h3>
<p>The adventures in Kellar’s Keep are played in the same way as
the adventures in the original game. However, you will notice two
main differences:</p>
<p>Firstly, players do not start the adventures on the stairway tile. Instead,
they enter via a door on the edge of the gameboard, unless instructed
otherwise. The door through which they must enter the gameboard is
shown with a white arrow.</p>
<p>Players may only leave the gameboard by locating either another door on
the edge of the gameboard or the stairway tile.</p>
<p>The Evil Wizard player should use the new door pieces when placing a
door on the edge of the gameboard.</p>
<p>Secondly, as with the last three adventures in the original Quest Book,
the adventures in Kellar’s Keep fit together. You may play several
adventures in a row if you wish. Characters are returned to full strength
and may choose new spells between adventures.</p>
`
intro_kk_eu = `
<p>“Friends, as you know, the Emperor is besieged
in Kellar's Keep. the inner bastion of Karak Varn. The
fortress is well defended, but I fear that time is against
us. The garrison weakens with starvation, while the enemy
grows stronger by the day.</p>
<p>“There is a way in which we can help. The great book
Loretome has revealed a secret passage to me, that has long been
forgotten. It will be your task to find this passage and bring the
Emperor to safety. The passage is known as Grin's Crag and is named
after the Dwarf who first discovered the passage. Grin was a
loner, his life devoted to the search for a rich vein of gold. He never
found one. Yet, whilst searching, he found a narrow footpath running
along the edge of an abyss. He explored beyond and found himself in
the lower caverns of Kellar's Keep, the inner bastion of Karak
Varn (the great Dwarven stronghold that lies within the heart
of the World's Edge Mountains). Grin carved a map onto a stone
tablet so that he might find the path again. This he gave to his
Lord, Belorn.</p>
<p>“The Worlds Edge Mountains stretch along the eastern
edge of the Empire. Many thousands of years ago the Dwarves made
these mountains their home. With their great engineering skills
they built vast cities that cut deep into the rock. The cities were
connected by tunnels that stretched for miles beneath the
mountains. On the eastern side of the mountains the Dwarves
constructed huge fortresses to guard against the Dark Lands.
The greatest of these was Karak Varn.</p>
<p>“The Dwarves lived for many years in peace. for the
Orcs and Goblins did not dare trouble them after their terrible
defeat at Keloth's Tor. But during this time of peace the Dwarves
let their fortresses decline. The garrisons became smaller and
the guards less vigilant. Then came Morcar. He had been patient
and had spent years raising a new army of Orcs and Goblins.
When the attack came there was no warning. The Dwarves
fought with great Valour but their enemies were too many.
One by one the cities fell. Only Karak Varn held.</p>
<p>“You will need to journey through the Halls of Belorn,
ancient passages that lie deep beneath the Worlds Edge Mountains.
The Halls of Belorn are now ruined. They have been stripped
of the riches that once adorned the many passages and chambers.
Only Orcs and Goblins dwell there now. You must make them
pay dearly for their tresspass.</p>
<p>“Even Loretome cannot show exactly where the secret
passage lies. You must find the four pieces of Grin's map, that are
scattered throughout his halls, if you are to locate the path to
Kellar's Keep. You must not fail, for should you do so, our cause
will be lost. I shall take you to the Great Gate, but from there
you will be on your own. Prepare yourselves, for we
leave in the morning.</p>
`
outro_kk_eu = `
<p>The door opened into the darkness of Kellar's Keep.
From far above came the thunder of battle. The forces of
Morcar were making their last, remorseless, assault. This time
there could be no holding them. The Emperor assembled his
captains, determined to organise one last line of defence. Then
came the news: a group of Champions had found a way through
from the Halls of Belorn.</p>
<p>Without hesitation the Emperor ordered his captains
to fall their men back towards Grin's Crag. The guard would take
the rear and fight their way back to the passage, thus giving time
for the rest of the army and the wounded to reach safety. The
guard fought with such strength and courage that the Orcs and
Goblins of Morcar's army fell back. not daring to close with such
a fearsome foe. Morcar looked to his left, then pointed
menancingly towards the Emperor's guard. The Doomguard
stirred from their silence, and moved forward.</p>
<p>The Emperor's guard slowly fell back before them
until the gate was reached. Then it fell to one man to hold the
enemy while the passage behind him was destroyed so that none
could pass. Kenaron, the captain of the guard stood in the gate.
Time and again the heavily clad warriors of the Doomguard
surged forward to be felled by Kanaron’s sword. Morcar
watched for a while, and smiled wryly at Kenaron's courage
and skill-at-arms. A moment later his patience was spent.
Kenaron fell before the storm of flame that burst against the
gate. But it was too late. Morcar's warriors howled in anger,
for the passage was destroyed. The Emperor and the last of his
army had escaped.</p>
<p>“You have done well. The Emperor has asked me to
express his gratitude. Each of you will receive 500 gold coins for
your efforts. But do not let this victory deceive you. A dark
cloud still hangs over the Empire. The army is in need of rest.
Yet the forces of chaos still advance from the East, nothing
stands before them. We are in need of time. I shall look to how
we might delay Morcar's advance. Rest well my friends.</p>
<p>“Once I have consulted Loretome I shall
summon you."</p>
`
intro_rotwl_eu = `
<p>Mentor's head hung low as he entered the room. There
was a sadness in his voice when he spoke.</p>
<p>"Worthy companions, the Witch Lord is not
dead. We must act fast. for his power grows with the
passing of each day. It will not be long before he has
recovered from his imprisonment. Once his power has
fully awoken he will raise again the legions of the dead.
These warriors are a fearsome foe. Only men of great
courage, or those with powerful magic. can stand
against them. They know no fear and will fight
relentlessly until they are destroyed.</p>
"Loretome has shown me that the Witch Lord
has moved from Barak Tor to the fallen city of Kalos.
Long ago the city was destroyed by Morcar and given
to the Witch Lord to rule. Beneath the ruins the
Witch Lord built for himself a great stronghold, for
the light of day was too pure for his foul creatures to
endure. When he was defeated, the stronghold's gates
were shut and no one ventured in or out. Now he has
returned.</p>
<p>"As he sits upon the High throne of Kalos.
the Witch Lord may look upon the Plains of Death
and see any who approach: none can escape his gaze.
The High throne is one of three thrones that wait for
those who would also preside over the Court of the
Dead. If the Witch Lord is not stopped soon, the other
thrones will be taken: one by Skulmar the Captain of
the Dead Host: the other by Kessandria the Witch
Queen. When these two sit alongside the Witch Lord
it is said that the bones of all fallen warriors will be
summoned together under the Black Banner.</p>
<p>"Many days of travel have brought you across
the Plains of Death. The journey has been hard, for
the land here is barren, scorched by the relentless sun.
Throughout your journey you have felt an uneasy
presence. Ever since you entered the Plains, the Witch
Lord has watched your progress, awaiting your arrival.
Finally, you have reached the great ruins. The skeletal
remains of a once resplendent city that rose from rich
and fertile land now lies parched and dust-clogged."</p>
`
outro_rotwl_eu = `
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>"The Witch Lord has been defeated and his
army of the dead remains asleep under the earth. The
magic that animated them has been weakened. Yet this
victory could herald our downfall if we relax our
struggle. Now is the time for our efforts to be
renewed. Now the foe is weaker, our blow must be all
the stronger. The minions of the Witch Lord who
escaped are still active and will surely strive to have
revenge on those who defeated their master. Indeed.
Loretome has shown me that Skulmar, who we believed
to be slain, has escaped from the ruins of Kalos with
many of the Witch Lord's most powerful spell books.
He was aided by the traitorous Sir Ragnar who you
once rescued from the forces of Chaos but who has now
been corrupted by that same influence. I fear that it
will not be long before you will have to confront
Skulmar and attempt to end this threat forever,
although Sir Ragnar has been captured and executed.</p>
<p>"But for the present you have earned yourselves
a rest. So come, my friends, the Emperor awaits you in
the Grand Palace. Tonight you are to be honoured
for your incredible feats of heroism in the presence of
the nobility of the whole Empire."</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><em>Against the Ogre Horde</em> confronts our valiant heroes with a threat far more
dangerous than anything they have yet encountered: the Dirgrusht Ogre clan.
This Quest book contains new rules for the Ogres, rules for monsters with variable
Body points and new rules for Mind points. There are seven new Quests which will
test the courage and resourcefulness of the Emperor’s Heroes like never before.</p>
<h1>Assembly Instructions</h1>
<p>Before you begin to play <em>Against
The Ogre Horde</em>, carefully punch
out all the components from the new die-
cut sheet. The new door pieces fit into the
existing door bases in the same way as
normal doors.</p>
<p>There are four different types of Ogre
miniatures, each illustrated on the back
cover. Be sure to match the correct arms
and heads to each body. All Ogres
assemble as follows:</p>
<p>Carefully remove all the pieces from the plastic sprues. Take the front half of the
Ogre and place the left and right arms into the shoulder sockets. Next, push the
back of the Ogre into place, squeezing firmly. Finally, push the Ogre’s head into its
socket. Repeat the sequence for each Ogre.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/assembly_ogre.jpg"/>
<div class="speech">
<h4>Ogre Background</h4>
<p>Ogres see the world as one long series of meals: enemies mean
lunch or breakfast, depending on the time of day. More often than not,
Ogre duels are vast eating competitions - although violent brawls
make a good substitute.</p>
<p>As enemies, Ogres are ruthless foes who show no mercy once
their appetite has been whetted. Anyone brave enough to do battle
with the Ogres must be sure of their own fighting prowess. Otherwise.
they might not just end up dead... they'll end up as someone's dinner!</p>
<p>Ogres are not evil as such. Just permanently hungry and
frighteningly violent. Often they just wander about alone. At other
times, they group together in clans led by an Ogre Lord - whoever is
the meanest, nastiest and hungriest at that particular time.</p>
<p>It is possible for both the Empire and the forces of Chaos to
hire Ogres as mercenaries, so long as they are guaranteed a good time
- a brawl and plenty to eat (usually as a result of the fighting). But
their habits make them unpredictable and horribly dangerous.</p>
</div>
<h1>Ogres in HeroQuest</h1>
<p>All Ogres occupy one space on the HeroQuest gameboard. No other figure may
pass through the same space as an Ogre figure, whether they are good or evil.
Once an Ogre blocks a corridor, it stays blocked until he moves or is killed.</p>
<p>HeroQuest Ogres are more powerful than any monsters so far encountered by our heroes.
Compare the relative strengths of the different Ogres:</p>

<p><img src="Icons/Raster/Europe/AgainstTheOgreHoard/AgainstTheOgreHoard.OgreLord_EU.png"/><b>Ogre Lord</b> Move 4 spaces Attack 6 dice Defend 6 dice Body <em>Variable</em> Mind 5</p>
<h1>Variable Body Points</h1>
<h2>Monsters with more than one Body Point</h2>
<p>Powerful monsters such as Ogres have more than one Body point. A single Body
point track is used to record ALL Body points lost by the Ogres. Each time an
Ogre loses a Body point, one box is crossed off the Body point track. If one of the
boxes crossed off contains a skull then that Ogre is killed immediately and his
piece is removed from the board; any excess Body points scored in that attack are
not recorded.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> <em>The diagram below shows a Body point track for the Ogres in one of the
Quests. In this Quest, the Barbarian meets two Ogres and attacks one of them, scoring
two Body points against it (1). These two points are immediately crossed off on the Body
point track. The Dwarf then joins the Barbarian (2) and attacks the second Ogre, scoring
two Body points as well. However, as the next box on the Body point track is a skull, the
Ogre is killed at once and the second Body point is not recorded.</em></p>
<p>1 Barbarian Attack</p>
<table class="bodypoints"><td>X</td><td>X</td><th/><td/><td/><td/><th/><td/><td/><th/><td/><td/><th/></table>
<p>2 Dwarf Attack</p>
<table class="bodypoints"><td>X</td><td>X</td><th>X</th><td/><td/><td/><th/><td/><td/><th/><td/><td/><th/></table>
<h2>Monsters with Extra Body Points</h2>
<p>Certain personality monsters such as an Ogre Lord or an Orc Warlord might have a
personal set of extra Body points which will be specified in the individual Quest.
These monsters will each have their own special Body point track which will appear
next to their characteristics in the Quest notes. When a personality monster loses
Body points, the lost Body points are recorded against his own personal Body point
track and not the Ogre Body point track.</p>
<h1>New Dungeon Features</h1>
<p>Ogre Horde introduces a number of new features to the dungeon which are
explained below. Counters for Stone Doorways and Pits of Darkness are
provided on the new die-cut sheet.</p>
<h2>Stone Doorways</h2>
<p>Stone Doorways are large slabs of rock which must be pushed out
of the way using brute force before you can pass. To open one of
these doors, a character must roll a number of combat dice and
score two skulls. The number of dice he throws depends on what
character type he is: the Dwarf and the Elf both roll two dice, the
Barbarian rolls three dice. The Wizard cannot open a Stone
Doorway. Once a Stone Doorway has been opened it remains open
for the rest of the Quest.</p>
<img src="Icons/Raster/Europe/AgainstTheOgreHoard/AgainstTheOgreHoard.StoneDoorway_EU.png"/>
<h2>Swinging Blade Trap</h2>
<p>The trap is tripped when a character lands on a space marked with a black blade
symbol: a huge blade swings down from the roof attacking any character in any one
of the three spaces marked with a white or black blade symbol. These characters
will be attacked with two combat dice which they may defend against normally.
A Swinging Blade Trap can only be detected by a search in the room or corridor
containing the black blade symbol.</p>
<p>Any character with a Tool Kit may attempt to disarm a Swinging Blade Trap. To do
so they must roll any shield, using only one combat die. If they roll a skull, they
will set off the Swinging Blade Trap. The Dwarf may disarm a Swinging Blade Trap
automatically once it has been discovered.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> <em>In the diagram below, the Elf moves five spaces and lands on a white blade
space. He does not set off the trap, but on his turn, the Barbarian moves four spaces and
lands on the black blade space. The blade swings down attacking both the Elf and the
Barbarian with two combat dice.</em></p>
<img src="Images/Rules/swinging_blade.jpg"></img>
<h2>Pits of Darkness</h2>
<p>The Pit of Darkness Trap works in the same way as a normal pit trap with the
following exceptions: if a character crossing a Pit of Darkness space rolls a skull, he
plunges 30 feet onto hard floor. Once he falls, a character will suffer damage
depending on how much armour he is wearing. Characters not
wearing any armour must roll one combat die to see if they lose a
Body point; those wearing Chain-mail or Borin's Armour must
roll two combat dice; and those wearing plate mail must roll
three combat dice. A character may climb out of a Pit of
Darkness on his next turn if there is a free space on any one side
of the Pit of Darkness.</p>
<img src="Icons/Raster/Europe/AgainstTheOgreHoard/AgainstTheOgreHoard.DeepPitTrap_EU.png"/>
<p>Pits of Darkness may not be disarmed but characters may jump over them like
ordinary pit traps.</p>
<h1>Chaos Sorcerer Spells</h1>
<p>Below are three new Chaos Spells which use Mind points to affect their
targets. Mind Points are a measure of a character’s wisdom and a measure of
a character’s magical aptitude. They show how well they can use magic and, more
importantly, how well they can resist it. These new Chaos Spells have spell tokens
which monsters will use when allocated them in the Quest notes.</p>
<p>Chaos Sorcerers may only cast one spell a turn. A spell can be cast at any character
to which the Chaos Sorcerer has a clear line of sight. A Chaos Sorcerer who casts a
spell may also move but may not engage in hand to hand combat in that turn. If a
Chaos Sorcerer casts a spell and is killed, that spell stops working at once.</p>
<p><b>For example:</b> <em>If the Chaos Sorcerer uses a spell on a character and is killed before that
character’s turn, the Chaos Sorcerer’s spell stops working at once. The character is free to
move on his next turn.</em></p>
<p>If a character has the Talisman of Lore, he receives an extra two Mind points. These
Mind points count towards that character’s Mind Combat total, as long as that
character has the Talisman.</p>
<h2>Mind Lock</h2>
<p>This spell allows a servant of Chaos to freeze a hero’s mind and prevent him from
taking any action. The Chaos Sorcerer makes a Mind Attack against his target by
rolling a number of combat dice equal to his Mind points. His target defends with
as many combat dice as he has Mind points. The defender is frozen for one turn for
each skull scored by the attacker. If no skulls are scored against the target, the spell
has no effect. A Mind Locked character places one Mind Lock token on his
character board for each turn he is affected, removing one on each of his turns.
Having removed a token, a frozen character may attempt to break the Chaos
Sorcerer’s hold by rolling one combat die for each Mind point. If he manages to
roll three skulls or more, he may remove all remaining Mind Lock tokens on his
character board. A frozen character may not move, attack or perform any other
action, but he may defend against other attacks using only one defence die.</p>
<h2>Dominate</h2>
<p>This spell allows a Chaos Sorcerer to take control of a hero for a turn. The Chaos
Sorcerer must attack his target by rolling a number of combat dice equal to his
Mind points while the defender does the same to defend himself. The Chaos
Sorcerer must score at least two skulls in his Mind Attack. If he is successful, the
Chaos Sorcerer places a Dominate counter on the character’s board and may move
that character immediately. He may move, cast spells and fight with the character as
normal and may attack the other players with him. A character is only Dominated
for the duration of the Chaos Sorcerer’s turn. If the attack is unsuccessful, nothing
happens.</p>
<h2>Mind Blast</h2>
<p>This spell allows a Chaos Sorcerer to inflict Mind point damage on another
character without having to be next to him or physically attacking him. A Chaos
Sorcerer with this spell receives the number of Mind Blast tokens specified in the
Quest. Each time he attacks, he must discard one of the tokens. He may only use as
many Mind Blasts as he has tokens.</p>
<p>To attack with a Mind Blast, both characters roll a number of combat dice equal to
their Mind Point score and add up the number of skulls they have. The one with
most skulls, be it attacker or defender, then inflicts Mind point damage on his
opponent equal to the number of skulls he has in excess of his opponent’s score.
If both scores are equal, neither character inflicts any damage. If a character or a
monster loses all his Mind points as a result of a Mind Blast, he is knocked
unconscious and remains out of play for the rest of that Quest. Mind points are
recovered between Quests in the same way as Body points.</p>

intro_atoh = `
<p>Morcar sat motionless on his throne of pure jet, deep
in thought. His eyes scanned the image of the Emperor's
lands which he had magically conjured before him. He had
been so close to victory, so nearly had he trapped and
destroyed the Emperor and his forces in the ancient fortress
at Karak Varn. But he had been foiled at the last minute
by the Emperor's accursed Champions. The same fate had
befallen his powerful ally the Witch Lord whose Army of
the Dead had crumbled following the slaying of their leader.</p>
<p>Morcar needed some new and subtle means to attack
the Empire and weaken its forces before he could lead his
armies against them once more. Suddenly his gaze froze and
a smile sent ripples through the lines of his ancient face.
A plan had come to him.</p>
<p>A month later, Morcar again sat back to examine
the scheme he had set in motion. He had never before
considered the ancient race of Ogres as a potential tool.
Their undisciplined and random nature made them unreliable
as servants and dangerous as allies. However, using the
magical arts at his disposal, Morcar had planted one of his
Chaos sorcerers, Festral, within the subterranean fortress
of the infamous Dirgrusht Ogre clan. Drawing from a
magical pool of Chaos power, Festral had subtly taken
control of the Ogre clan and started them on a series of
raids on the Emperor's Farmlands. This was only the
beginning, for as the raids went on, other Ogre clans and Orc
tribes came to swell the ranks of this new army.</p>

<p>As the rain lashed down and thunder rumbled across the sky, a brief
flash of lightning illuminated a bedraggled group of travellers. Their slow
climb up the rocky slopes to the foreboding tower at the summit seemed to
last an eternity. At last the figures escaped the storm and entered a dark
hallway. As they peered into the shadows, they saw a sinister figure on a
rocky throne.</p>
<p>A solitary traveller stepped forward from the huddled and dripping
group and addressed the presence on the throne.</p>
<p>"My Lord Morcar, we come bearing grave tidings. We must report
the failure of your plan to raise the Ogre Horde against the Empire. Once
again we were routed by his accursed Champions and once again we were
forced to flee."</p>
<p>The figure on the throne shifted and a voice like death broke the
silence.</p>
<p>"I am aware of your failure, Festral. But as in all things I have
learnt from my failures. Firstly I have learnt not to underestimate the
Emperor's Heroes. Secondly I have learnt not to rely on fools. I have
therefore conceived a new scheme to destroy the Emperor's Heroes forever.
I have chosen four Lieutenants to carry out my plan. Come forth my
Lieutenants."</p>
<p>With that command, four silhouettes stepped from the shadows.</p>
<p>"Let me present Zanrath, High Mage of Sarako.”</p>
<p>An ancient bearded man wearing a pointed hat and carrying a staff
topped with a crescent moon bowed down towards Festral and his retinue.</p>
<p>"Fanrax the Malicious.”</p>
<p>At the mention of his name, an evil-looking man adorned with skull
symbols and toying with a wickedly sharp dagger gave a sneering smile at
the group.</p>
<p>"Boroush, the Storm Master."</p>
<p>With a sweep of his oaken staff, a ragged and bearded figure greeted
the refugees.</p>
<yp>"And finally, Grawshak. Orc Shaman of the Northern Tribes."</p>
<p>The last of the four Lieutenants, an Orc decorated in skins, feathers
and skulls carrying a massive totem wand growled what might have been a
greeting or a curse at the party.</p>
<p>"I believe that these four Sorcerers will succeed where you so
miserably failed. And it is they who will punish you for your failure.”</p>
<p>With this final word, Morcar disappeared into the shadows. From
here he watched with great satisfaction as his four sorcerous Lieutenants
erased all trace of Festral and his followers.</p>
<p>Morcar smiled. These were indeed the ones who would finally
destroy the Emperor's heroes forever.</p>

<h1>New Magic</h1>
<h2>The Forces of Morcar</h2>
<p>Wizards of Morcar introduces four powerful new adversaries for the Heroes. Each of these
new opponents is a Sorcerer and has his own set of sorcerous spells which he may use
in the same way as the Wizard and the Elf.</p>
<p>Each Sorcerer has his own special set of six spells which only he may use. For example,
only the Necromancer may use the Necromancer spells and only the Orc Shaman may
use the Orc Shaman spells.</p>
<p>Each Sorcerer may only cast one spellin a turn, instead of attacking. Each spell may
only be used once in each Quest.</p>
<p>Each new Quest starts with a full set of six spells for each Sorcerer in that Quest.</p>
<h2>New Spells for the Emperor’s Heroes</h2>
<p>There are also three new sets of spells for the Wizard and Elf: Spells of Protection, Spells
of Detection and Spells of Darkness. These may be added to the existing sets of spells
which the Elf and Wizard draw on, but they may still only choose one and three sets of
spells respectively. They may still change their spells between Quests.</p>
<h1>Spell Special Effects</h1>
<p>Several of the new spells have special effects which can be displayed on
the board using the special counters on the card sheet. Details of each spell
appear on each spell card while the general rules of effect are detailed below.</p>
<h3>Magical Barriers</h3>
<p>Wall of Ice, Wall of Flame and Wall of Stone spells allow the caster to build a solid
barrier which will appear on the board as a card piece standing on a plastic base.
This barrier may be placed across two squares on the gameboard to form a solid
impassable wall that will remain on the board until it is destroyed. The wall may
resist an attack by rolling the number of defence dice shown on the specific spell
card and counting the white shields scored. If the wall takes one Body point or
more of damage, it is destroyed and the piece is removed from the board.</p>
<h3>Lightning Bolts and Earthquakes</h3>
<p>When a player casts either of these spells, he or she takes the relevant card piece
and places one end in a square in front of the sorcerer and then lays the piece in a
straight line from there. That spell then affects anyone along that line, unless a wall
blocks the way, in which case a Lightning Bolt attack will stop there, attacking only
those in front of the wall.</p>
<p>The Earthquake tile covers 6 squares, each of which counts as a pit trap except that
they are all joined up. Players may move in the normal way along the bottom of the
quake but can only leave it by climbing out onto a clear square adjacent to it.
Figures in the quake area may fight and cast spells as normal but may only do so
with figures inside the quake area.</p>
<p>If an Earthquake meets a wall, that wall is breached and a breached wall token is
placed there. Any figure may move through a breached wall. If a room which has
not been explored is breached, the contents should be laid out at once. If the
Earthquake meets a Magical Wall, both spells are cancelled and the pieces are
removed from the board.</p>
<h3>Magical Traps</h3>
<p>Whenever a character enters a room described in the Quest notes as containing a
magical trap, the Evil Wizard player must refer to the Magic Reference Chart to see
the effect of that particular trap.</p>
<p>Magical traps cannot be found by searching. They can only be disarmed with
certain spells specified on the Magic Reference Chart. Magical traps may only be
activated once. As soon as a magical trap has been activated, players can move safely
through that room or corridor.</p>
<h1>Men-at-Arms</h1>
<p>Once a Hero has become a Champion and his deeds are talked about in \
taverns and around camp fires all over the land, he will want a band of
followers to aid him in even greater feats of heroism.</p>
<p>Such men are found in towns and cities all around the country. Men willing to
follow a great Champion and fight for him as long as he will pay for their upkeep.</p>
<p>There are four types of Men-at-Arms. Each has his own strengths and weaknesses
and each has his own price.</p>
<img src="Images/Cards/pic_menatarms_crossbowman.jpg" style="float: left;filter: grayscale(1);clear: both"/>
<h2>The Crossbowman</h2>
<p>
The Crossbowman has a low number of attack
dice but has the power to make ranged attacks.
This allows him to shoot at monsters who are
waiting behind hidden traps or are too far away
to attack in close combat.</p>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
<img src="Images/Cards/pic_menatarms_swordsman.jpg" style="float: left;filter: grayscale(1);"/>
<h2>The Swordsman</h2>
<p>The Swordsman is a great offensive fighter able
to take on more powerful creatures such as the
Gargoyle, Mummies or Chaos Warriors.
However, he is slow and cannot join in any fast
sorties, although his high defence capability
makes him useful against any massed attacks.</p>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
<img src="Images/Cards/pic_menatarms_scout.jpg" style="float: left;filter: grayscale(1);"/>
<h2>The Scout</h2>
<p>The Scout’s low attack dice reduce his chances
of doing huge amounts of damage to monsters,
but he moves fast and has the ability to search
for and disarm traps.</p>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
<img src="Images/Cards/pic_menatarms_halberdier.jpg" style="float: left;filter: grayscale(1);"/>
<h2>The Halberdier</h2>
<p>The Halberdier has equal attack and defence
capabilities. This and his relatively high
movement capability make him a versatile
companion to take on an adventure.</p>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
<h2>Hiring Men-at-Arms</h2>
<p>Adventurers may each hire up to four followers at any time between Quests. These
followers may be from any of the four types of Men-at-Arms. To hire a Man-at-
Arms, an adventurer must pay the initial Price to Hire which appears on the Man-
at-Arms Card. That Man-at-Arms will then stay with and fight for that Champion
until he, the Man-at-Arms, is killed and as long as he-is paid 10 gold coins at the
end of each Quest. If he is not paid for his services, he will leave and must be paid
his full Price to Hire in order to return.</p>
<p>For each Man-at-Arms a Hero hires, that player should take one Man-at-Arms
figure with the relevant weapon shown on that Man-At-Arms’ Card. He should also
take one Man-at-Arms Card for each of the types he has hired. This details the
statistics of each type of Man-at-Arms. (Note: a number of spare Men-at-Arms cards
have been provided to replace any lost or damaged cards.)
A player whose Champion is killed can choose to continue the quest with the
Champion’s surviving Men-at-Arms. If not, he must remove the Men-at-Arms from
the gameboard.</p>
<p>Example: Thorgrin the Dwarf decides to hire a couple of Men-at-Arms to aid him
on his Quests: one Crossbownan to shoot any targets that they cannot reach on foot
and one Halberdier to act as general extra muscle. This costs Thorgrin 125 gold
coins before he sets out on the Quest, but it will also cost him 20 gold coins at the
end of each Quest, assuming of course that both his Men-at-Arms survive.</p>
<h1>Men-at-Arms in the Game</h1>
<p>Once a player has hired any Men-at-Arms, he can take them with
him on his next Quest. Each player begins the Quest in turn by placing
all his figures on the stairway tile or in any adjacent squares and then takes his turn
before the next player sets up.</p>
<ul>
<li>On their turn, each player moves his hero and then moves all of his Men-at-Arms.</li>
<li>Each Man-at-Arms may move and fight in the same way as the Heroes, using the
movement and combat values printed on the Man-at-Arms Card.</li>
<li>When defending, Men-at-Arms count the white shields.</li>
<li>Men-at-Arms can open closed doors and jump over pit traps.</li>
<li>Men-at-Arms may not search for treasure, use any equipment or treasure cards
and only scouts may search for and attempt to disarm traps.</li>
<li>Any money given to a Man-at-Arms cannot be retrieved, even after his death.</li>
</ul>
