<p>The fire burns warmly, but casts little light into Mentor's study.
The flickering shadows only hint at the vast number of books and scrolls
that fill the many shelves. Slowly Mentor walks over to the fire.
<br/>"Well, my friends, your training is complete. You are not yet
Heroes, you have yet to prove yourselves. But first, let me tell you of
Morcar........</p>
<p>"Many centuries ago, Morcar was my apprentice. He worked hard
and learned quickly. But impatience devoured him, and he wanted to learn
more powerful magic. I told him of the dangers, and that he should be
patient, for in time he would become a great wizard. But Morcar could
not wait: each night he broke into my study and read my spell books. The
secrets that were held within them were great indeed. Once he had learnt
these secrets. Morcar fled.</p>
<p>"When I caught up with him, I found him greatly changed. He had
pledged his allegiance to the Great Powers of Chaos. Fool! He saw magic
only as a short-cut to power and paid no heed to the terrible price he
would have to pay. I tried to reason with him, but to no avail. He laughed
in my face and then unleashed a terrible spell which I was hard-pressed to
counter. For many days we battled. but Morcar had allies stronger even
than I, and I could not defeat him. In the end, as we both weakened, he
fled and sought refuge in the Northern Chaos Wastes. There he licked his
wounds and honed his skills, conjuring ancient powers with which to
overthrow the Empire. But he knows not what he has done. They will
serve him while it suits their own dark purposes, but in time they will
destroy him.</p>
<p>"I must watch Morcar and measure the strength of his magic. This
I may do with the help of Loretome. The powers Morcar has called
upon will destroy us all if I relax from this vigil. Morcar's legions have
threatened us once before. Then it was Rogar who aided me and defeated
them. Now they are on the march again: already they have assailed the
Borderlands. The Empire must again look for Heroes and to this end have
I trained you.</p>
<p>"Each of you must complete three tasks. If you do this, you will be
acclaimed as Champions of the Realm and dubbed Imperial Knights.
Then will you truly be on the road to becoming a Hero. I shall
speak with you again on your return - if you return......."</p>
`
outro_gs_eu = `
<p>"You have done well. And yet it seems your task is hardly begun.
Dark clouds gather at the Empire's borders...</p>
<p>"The Emperor rode with his army towards Black Fire Pass, that
perilous mountain route linking the Empire and the Borderlands. No such
army has ever been raised in living memory. Greater even than Rogar's
host it was. They drew up their battle lines on the grassy plains at the
foot of the mountain road and waited. 'Ere nightfall, the sky darkened and
a great wind arose. Spine-chilling shrieks and howls echoed from the
mountain tops. terrifying the horses and filling man and elf alike with
fear.</p>
<p>"Then came the first assault. Pouring down the mountainsive as
though it were a gentle slope rather than an almost vertical cliff, the
hordes of Morcar fell upon the Empire's defenders. Like a black wave they
came: but the lines held and it seemed we should win the day.</p>
<p>"But I had not reckoned with Morcar's magic. He stood high on a
ridge overlooking the battlefield and unleashed his terrible magic.
Lightning flashed from his fingertips and great gouts of flame exploded
among the defenders. Our lines were breached in a dozen places at once and
the enemy howled in delight.</p>
<p>"Then came the Doomguard - Morcar's elite force of Chaos
Knights. Our army broke and ran. Only the Emperor's personal guard held
their ground and many sacrificed themselves to ensure his safe retreat.</p>
<p>"The remnants of the army are now holed up in Karak Varn - the
ancient dwarven stronghold. They do not have provisions for a long siege,
however, so we must act swiftly if we are to save the Emperor and his
army.</p>
<p>"Yet there is another evil to be confronted. The Witch Lord lives.
He too had magic I had not foreseen and was protected from the Spirit
Blade. He was sorely wounded, however, and fled to his ancient retreat in
the Black Mountains. But soon he will have recovered enough to lead the
Legion of the Damned once more.</p>
<p>"The Empire has great need of you. I myself cannot act against
these dangers, for I must move against Morcar and strive to weaken his
power. Until we meet again, take care, my friends. Farewell......."</p>

<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p>Before you can begin to play the adventures
in Kellar’s Keep you must first punch out
the new cardboard components from the die-cut
sheet. Take two of the open doors and remove the
card, but do not throw them away. The new door
pieces should then be folded and fitted into two
door bases as shown.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/assembly_inoutdoor.jpg"></img>
<h3>Playing Kellar’s Keep</h3>
<p>The adventures in Kellar’s Keep are played in the same way as
the adventures in the original game. However, you will notice two
main differences:</p>
<p>Firstly, players do not start the adventures on the stairway tile. Instead,
they enter via a door on the edge of the gameboard, unless instructed
otherwise. The door through which they must enter the gameboard is
shown with a white arrow.</p>
<p>Players may only leave the gameboard by locating either another door on
the edge of the gameboard or the stairway tile.</p>
<p>The Evil Wizard player should use the new door pieces when placing a
door on the edge of the gameboard.</p>
<p>Secondly, as with the last three adventures in the original Quest Book,
the adventures in Kellar’s Keep fit together. You may play several
adventures in a row if you wish. Characters are returned to full strength
and may choose new spells between adventures.</p>
`
intro_kk_eu = `
<p>“Friends, as you know, the Emperor is besieged
in Kellar's Keep. the inner bastion of Karak Varn. The
fortress is well defended, but I fear that time is against
us. The garrison weakens with starvation, while the enemy
grows stronger by the day.</p>
<p>“There is a way in which we can help. The great book
Loretome has revealed a secret passage to me, that has long been
forgotten. It will be your task to find this passage and bring the
Emperor to safety. The passage is known as Grin's Crag and is named
after the Dwarf who first discovered the passage. Grin was a
loner, his life devoted to the search for a rich vein of gold. He never
found one. Yet, whilst searching, he found a narrow footpath running
along the edge of an abyss. He explored beyond and found himself in
the lower caverns of Kellar's Keep, the inner bastion of Karak
Varn (the great Dwarven stronghold that lies within the heart
of the World's Edge Mountains). Grin carved a map onto a stone
tablet so that he might find the path again. This he gave to his
Lord, Belorn.</p>
<p>“The Worlds Edge Mountains stretch along the eastern
edge of the Empire. Many thousands of years ago the Dwarves made
these mountains their home. With their great engineering skills
they built vast cities that cut deep into the rock. The cities were
connected by tunnels that stretched for miles beneath the
mountains. On the eastern side of the mountains the Dwarves
constructed huge fortresses to guard against the Dark Lands.
The greatest of these was Karak Varn.</p>
<p>“The Dwarves lived for many years in peace. for the
Orcs and Goblins did not dare trouble them after their terrible
defeat at Keloth's Tor. But during this time of peace the Dwarves
let their fortresses decline. The garrisons became smaller and
the guards less vigilant. Then came Morcar. He had been patient
and had spent years raising a new army of Orcs and Goblins.
When the attack came there was no warning. The Dwarves
fought with great Valour but their enemies were too many.
One by one the cities fell. Only Karak Varn held.</p>
<p>“You will need to journey through the Halls of Belorn,
ancient passages that lie deep beneath the Worlds Edge Mountains.
The Halls of Belorn are now ruined. They have been stripped
of the riches that once adorned the many passages and chambers.
Only Orcs and Goblins dwell there now. You must make them
pay dearly for their tresspass.</p>
<p>“Even Loretome cannot show exactly where the secret
passage lies. You must find the four pieces of Grin's map, that are
scattered throughout his halls, if you are to locate the path to
Kellar's Keep. You must not fail, for should you do so, our cause
will be lost. I shall take you to the Great Gate, but from there
you will be on your own. Prepare yourselves, for we
leave in the morning.</p>
`
outro_kk_eu = `
<p>The door opened into the darkness of Kellar's Keep.
From far above came the thunder of battle. The forces of
Morcar were making their last, remorseless, assault. This time
there could be no holding them. The Emperor assembled his
captains, determined to organise one last line of defence. Then
came the news: a group of Champions had found a way through
from the Halls of Belorn.</p>
<p>Without hesitation the Emperor ordered his captains
to fall their men back towards Grin's Crag. The guard would take
the rear and fight their way back to the passage, thus giving time
for the rest of the army and the wounded to reach safety. The
guard fought with such strength and courage that the Orcs and
Goblins of Morcar's army fell back. not daring to close with such
a fearsome foe. Morcar looked to his left, then pointed
menancingly towards the Emperor's guard. The Doomguard
stirred from their silence, and moved forward.</p>
<p>The Emperor's guard slowly fell back before them
until the gate was reached. Then it fell to one man to hold the
enemy while the passage behind him was destroyed so that none
could pass. Kenaron, the captain of the guard stood in the gate.
Time and again the heavily clad warriors of the Doomguard
surged forward to be felled by Kanaron’s sword. Morcar
watched for a while, and smiled wryly at Kenaron's courage
and skill-at-arms. A moment later his patience was spent.
Kenaron fell before the storm of flame that burst against the
gate. But it was too late. Morcar's warriors howled in anger,
for the passage was destroyed. The Emperor and the last of his
army had escaped.</p>
<p>“You have done well. The Emperor has asked me to
express his gratitude. Each of you will receive 500 gold coins for
your efforts. But do not let this victory deceive you. A dark
cloud still hangs over the Empire. The army is in need of rest.
Yet the forces of chaos still advance from the East, nothing
stands before them. We are in need of time. I shall look to how
we might delay Morcar's advance. Rest well my friends.</p>
<p>“Once I have consulted Loretome I shall
summon you."</p>
`
intro_rotwl_eu = `
<p>Mentor's head hung low as he entered the room. There
was a sadness in his voice when he spoke.</p>
<p>"Worthy companions, the Witch Lord is not
dead. We must act fast, for his power grows with the
passing of each day. It will not be long before he has
recovered from his imprisonment. Once his power has
fully awoken he will raise again the legions of the dead.
These warriors are a fearsome foe. Only men of great
courage, or those with powerful magic. can stand
against them. They know no fear and will fight
relentlessly until they are destroyed.</p>
"Loretome has shown me that the Witch Lord
has moved from Barak Tor to the fallen city of Kalos.
Long ago the city was destroyed by Morcar and given
to the Witch Lord to rule. Beneath the ruins the
Witch Lord built for himself a great stronghold, for
the light of day was too pure for his foul creatures to
endure. When he was defeated, the stronghold's gates
were shut and no one ventured in or out. Now he has
returned.</p>
<p>"As he sits upon the High throne of Kalos.
the Witch Lord may look upon the Plains of Death
and see any who approach: none can escape his gaze.
The High throne is one of three thrones that wait for
those who would also preside over the Court of the
Dead. If the Witch Lord is not stopped soon, the other
thrones will be taken: one by Skulmar the Captain of
the Dead Host: the other by Kessandria the Witch
Queen. When these two sit alongside the Witch Lord
it is said that the bones of all fallen warriors will be
summoned together under the Black Banner.</p>
<p>"Many days of travel have brought you across
the Plains of Death. The journey has been hard, for
the land here is barren, scorched by the relentless sun.
Throughout your journey you have felt an uneasy
presence. Ever since you entered the Plains, the Witch
Lord has watched your progress, awaiting your arrival.
Finally, you have reached the great ruins. The skeletal
remains of a once resplendent city that rose from rich
and fertile land now lies parched and dust-clogged."</p>
`
outro_rotwl_eu = `
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>"The Witch Lord has been defeated and his
army of the dead remains asleep under the earth. The
magic that animated them has been weakened. Yet this
victory could herald our downfall if we relax our
struggle. Now is the time for our efforts to be
renewed. Now the foe is weaker, our blow must be all
the stronger. The minions of the Witch Lord who
escaped are still active and will surely strive to have
revenge on those who defeated their master. Indeed.
Loretome has shown me that Skulmar, who we believed
to be slain, has escaped from the ruins of Kalos with
many of the Witch Lord's most powerful spell books.
He was aided by the traitorous Sir Ragnar who you
once rescued from the forces of Chaos but who has now
been corrupted by that same influence. I fear that it
will not be long before you will have to confront
Skulmar and attempt to end this threat forever,
although Sir Ragnar has been captured and executed.</p>
<p>"But for the present you have earned yourselves
a rest. So come, my friends, the Emperor awaits you in
the Grand Palace. Tonight you are to be honoured
for your incredible feats of heroism in the presence of
the nobility of the whole Empire."</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><em>Against the Ogre Horde</em> confronts our valiant heroes with a threat far more
dangerous than anything they have yet encountered: the Dirgrusht Ogre clan.
This Quest book contains new rules for the Ogres, rules for monsters with variable
Body points and new rules for Mind points. There are seven new Quests which will
test the courage and resourcefulness of the Emperor’s Heroes like never before.</p>
<h1>Assembly Instructions</h1>
<p>Before you begin to play <em>Against
The Ogre Horde</em>, carefully punch
out all the components from the new die-
cut sheet. The new door pieces fit into the
existing door bases in the same way as
normal doors.</p>
<p>There are four different types of Ogre
miniatures, each illustrated on the back
cover. Be sure to match the correct arms
and heads to each body. All Ogres
assemble as follows:</p>
<p>Carefully remove all the pieces from the plastic sprues. Take the front half of the
Ogre and place the left and right arms into the shoulder sockets. Next, push the
back of the Ogre into place, squeezing firmly. Finally, push the Ogre’s head into its
socket. Repeat the sequence for each Ogre.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/assembly_ogre.jpg"/>
<div class="speech">
<h4>Ogre Background</h4>
<p>Ogres see the world as one long series of meals: enemies mean
lunch or breakfast, depending on the time of day. More often than not,
Ogre duels are vast eating competitions - although violent brawls
make a good substitute.</p>
<p>As enemies, Ogres are ruthless foes who show no mercy once
their appetite has been whetted. Anyone brave enough to do battle
with the Ogres must be sure of their own fighting prowess. Otherwise.
they might not just end up dead... they'll end up as someone's dinner!</p>
<p>Ogres are not evil as such. Just permanently hungry and
frighteningly violent. Often they just wander about alone. At other
times, they group together in clans led by an Ogre Lord - whoever is
the meanest, nastiest and hungriest at that particular time.</p>
<p>It is possible for both the Empire and the forces of Chaos to
hire Ogres as mercenaries, so long as they are guaranteed a good time
- a brawl and plenty to eat (usually as a result of the fighting). But
their habits make them unpredictable and horribly dangerous.</p>
</div>
<h1>Ogres in HeroQuest</h1>
<p>All Ogres occupy one space on the HeroQuest gameboard. No other figure may
pass through the same space as an Ogre figure, whether they are good or evil.
Once an Ogre blocks a corridor, it stays blocked until he moves or is killed.</p>
<p>HeroQuest Ogres are more powerful than any monsters so far encountered by our heroes.
Compare the relative strengths of the different Ogres:</p>

<h1>Variable Body Points</h1>
<h2>Monsters with more than one Body Point</h2>
<p>Powerful monsters such as Ogres have more than one Body point. A single Body
point track is used to record ALL Body points lost by the Ogres. Each time an
Ogre loses a Body point, one box is crossed off the Body point track. If one of the
boxes crossed off contains a skull then that Ogre is killed immediately and his
piece is removed from the board; any excess Body points scored in that attack are
not recorded.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> <em>The diagram below shows a Body point track for the Ogres in one of the
Quests. In this Quest, the Barbarian meets two Ogres and attacks one of them, scoring
two Body points against it (1). These two points are immediately crossed off on the Body
point track. The Dwarf then joins the Barbarian (2) and attacks the second Ogre, scoring
two Body points as well. However, as the next box on the Body point track is a skull, the
Ogre is killed at once and the second Body point is not recorded.</em></p>
<p>1 Barbarian Attack</p>
<table class="bodypoints"><td>X</td><td>X</td><th/><td/><td/><td/><th/><td/><td/><th/><td/><td/><th/></table>
<p>2 Dwarf Attack</p>
<table class="bodypoints"><td>X</td><td>X</td><th>X</th><td/><td/><td/><th/><td/><td/><th/><td/><td/><th/></table>
<h2>Monsters with Extra Body Points</h2>
<p>Certain personality monsters such as an Ogre Lord or an Orc Warlord might have a
personal set of extra Body points which will be specified in the individual Quest.
These monsters will each have their own special Body point track which will appear
next to their characteristics in the Quest notes. When a personality monster loses
Body points, the lost Body points are recorded against his own personal Body point
track and not the Ogre Body point track.</p>
<h1>New Dungeon Features</h1>
<p>Ogre Horde introduces a number of new features to the dungeon which are
explained below. Counters for Stone Doorways and Pits of Darkness are
provided on the new die-cut sheet.</p>
<h2>Stone Doorways</h2>
<p>Stone Doorways are large slabs of rock which must be pushed out
of the way using brute force before you can pass. To open one of
these doors, a character must roll a number of combat dice and
score two skulls. The number of dice he throws depends on what
character type he is: the Dwarf and the Elf both roll two dice, the
Barbarian rolls three dice. The Wizard cannot open a Stone
Doorway. Once a Stone Doorway has been opened it remains open
for the rest of the Quest.</p>
<img src="Icons/Raster/Europe/AgainstTheOgreHoard/AgainstTheOgreHoard.StoneDoorway_EU.png"/>
<h2>Swinging Blade Trap</h2>
<p>The trap is tripped when a character lands on a space marked with a black blade
symbol: a huge blade swings down from the roof attacking any character in any one
of the three spaces marked with a white or black blade symbol. These characters
will be attacked with two combat dice which they may defend against normally.
A Swinging Blade Trap can only be detected by a search in the room or corridor
containing the black blade symbol.</p>
<p>Any character with a Tool Kit may attempt to disarm a Swinging Blade Trap. To do
so they must roll any shield, using only one combat die. If they roll a skull, they
will set off the Swinging Blade Trap. The Dwarf may disarm a Swinging Blade Trap
automatically once it has been discovered.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> <em>In the diagram below, the Elf moves five spaces and lands on a white blade
space. He does not set off the trap, but on his turn, the Barbarian moves four spaces and
lands on the black blade space. The blade swings down attacking both the Elf and the
Barbarian with two combat dice.</em></p>
<img src="Images/Rules/swinging_blade.jpg"></img>
<h2>Pits of Darkness</h2>
<p>The Pit of Darkness Trap works in the same way as a normal pit trap with the
following exceptions: if a character crossing a Pit of Darkness space rolls a skull, he
plunges 30 feet onto hard floor. Once he falls, a character will suffer damage
depending on how much armour he is wearing. Characters not
wearing any armour must roll one combat die to see if they lose a
Body point; those wearing Chain-mail or Borin's Armour must
roll two combat dice; and those wearing plate mail must roll
three combat dice. A character may climb out of a Pit of
Darkness on his next turn if there is a free space on any one side
of the Pit of Darkness.</p>
<img src="Icons/Raster/Europe/AgainstTheOgreHoard/AgainstTheOgreHoard.DeepPitTrap_EU.png"/>
<p>Pits of Darkness may not be disarmed but characters may jump over them like
ordinary pit traps.</p>
<h1>Chaos Sorcerer Spells</h1>
<p>Below are three new Chaos Spells which use Mind points to affect their
targets. Mind Points are a measure of a character’s wisdom and a measure of
a character’s magical aptitude. They show how well they can use magic and, more
importantly, how well they can resist it. These new Chaos Spells have spell tokens
which monsters will use when allocated them in the Quest notes.</p>
<p>Chaos Sorcerers may only cast one spell a turn. A spell can be cast at any character
to which the Chaos Sorcerer has a clear line of sight. A Chaos Sorcerer who casts a
spell may also move but may not engage in hand to hand combat in that turn. If a
Chaos Sorcerer casts a spell and is killed, that spell stops working at once.</p>
<p><b>For example:</b> <em>If the Chaos Sorcerer uses a spell on a character and is killed before that
character’s turn, the Chaos Sorcerer’s spell stops working at once. The character is free to
move on his next turn.</em></p>
<p>If a character has the Talisman of Lore, he receives an extra two Mind points. These
Mind points count towards that character’s Mind Combat total, as long as that
character has the Talisman.</p>
<h2>Mind Lock</h2>
<p>This spell allows a servant of Chaos to freeze a hero’s mind and prevent him from
taking any action. The Chaos Sorcerer makes a Mind Attack against his target by
rolling a number of combat dice equal to his Mind points. His target defends with
as many combat dice as he has Mind points. The defender is frozen for one turn for
each skull scored by the attacker. If no skulls are scored against the target, the spell
has no effect. A Mind Locked character places one Mind Lock token on his
character board for each turn he is affected, removing one on each of his turns.
Having removed a token, a frozen character may attempt to break the Chaos
Sorcerer’s hold by rolling one combat die for each Mind point. If he manages to
roll three skulls or more, he may remove all remaining Mind Lock tokens on his
character board. A frozen character may not move, attack or perform any other
action, but he may defend against other attacks using only one defence die.</p>
<h2>Dominate</h2>
<p>This spell allows a Chaos Sorcerer to take control of a hero for a turn. The Chaos
Sorcerer must attack his target by rolling a number of combat dice equal to his
Mind points while the defender does the same to defend himself. The Chaos
Sorcerer must score at least two skulls in his Mind Attack. If he is successful, the
Chaos Sorcerer places a Dominate counter on the character’s board and may move
that character immediately. He may move, cast spells and fight with the character as
normal and may attack the other players with him. A character is only Dominated
for the duration of the Chaos Sorcerer’s turn. If the attack is unsuccessful, nothing
happens.</p>
<h2>Mind Blast</h2>
<p>This spell allows a Chaos Sorcerer to inflict Mind point damage on another
character without having to be next to him or physically attacking him. A Chaos
Sorcerer with this spell receives the number of Mind Blast tokens specified in the
Quest. Each time he attacks, he must discard one of the tokens. He may only use as
many Mind Blasts as he has tokens.</p>
<p>To attack with a Mind Blast, both characters roll a number of combat dice equal to
their Mind Point score and add up the number of skulls they have. The one with
most skulls, be it attacker or defender, then inflicts Mind point damage on his
opponent equal to the number of skulls he has in excess of his opponent’s score.
If both scores are equal, neither character inflicts any damage. If a character or a
monster loses all his Mind points as a result of a Mind Blast, he is knocked
unconscious and remains out of play for the rest of that Quest. Mind points are
recovered between Quests in the same way as Body points.</p>

intro_atoh = `
<p>Morcar sat motionless on his throne of pure jet, deep
in thought. His eyes scanned the image of the Emperor's
lands which he had magically conjured before him. He had
been so close to victory, so nearly had he trapped and
destroyed the Emperor and his forces in the ancient fortress
at Karak Varn. But he had been foiled at the last minute
by the Emperor's accursed Champions. The same fate had
befallen his powerful ally the Witch Lord whose Army of
the Dead had crumbled following the slaying of their leader.</p>
<p>Morcar needed some new and subtle means to attack
the Empire and weaken its forces before he could lead his
armies against them once more. Suddenly his gaze froze and
a smile sent ripples through the lines of his ancient face.
A plan had come to him.</p>
<p>A month later, Morcar again sat back to examine
the scheme he had set in motion. He had never before
considered the ancient race of Ogres as a potential tool.
Their undisciplined and random nature made them unreliable
as servants and dangerous as allies. However, using the
magical arts at his disposal, Morcar had planted one of his
Chaos sorcerers, Festral, within the subterranean fortress
of the infamous Dirgrusht Ogre clan. Drawing from a
magical pool of Chaos power, Festral had subtly taken
control of the Ogre clan and started them on a series of
raids on the Emperor's Farmlands. This was only the
beginning, for as the raids went on, other Ogre clans and Orc
tribes came to swell the ranks of this new army.</p>

<p>As the rain lashed down and thunder rumbled across the sky, a brief
flash of lightning illuminated a bedraggled group of travellers. Their slow
climb up the rocky slopes to the foreboding tower at the summit seemed to
last an eternity. At last the figures escaped the storm and entered a dark
hallway. As they peered into the shadows, they saw a sinister figure on a
rocky throne.</p>
<p>A solitary traveller stepped forward from the huddled and dripping
group and addressed the presence on the throne.</p>
<p>"My Lord Morcar, we come bearing grave tidings. We must report
the failure of your plan to raise the Ogre Horde against the Empire. Once
again we were routed by his accursed Champions and once again we were
forced to flee."</p>
<p>The figure on the throne shifted and a voice like death broke the
silence.</p>
<p>"I am aware of your failure, Festral. But as in all things I have
learnt from my failures. Firstly I have learnt not to underestimate the
Emperor's Heroes. Secondly I have learnt not to rely on fools. I have
therefore conceived a new scheme to destroy the Emperor's Heroes forever.
I have chosen four Lieutenants to carry out my plan. Come forth my
Lieutenants."</p>
<p>With that command, four silhouettes stepped from the shadows.</p>
<p>"Let me present Zanrath, High Mage of Sarako.”</p>
<p>An ancient bearded man wearing a pointed hat and carrying a staff
topped with a crescent moon bowed down towards Festral and his retinue.</p>
<p>"Fanrax the Malicious.”</p>
<p>At the mention of his name, an evil-looking man adorned with skull
symbols and toying with a wickedly sharp dagger gave a sneering smile at
the group.</p>
<p>"Boroush, the Storm Master."</p>
<p>With a sweep of his oaken staff, a ragged and bearded figure greeted
the refugees.</p>
<yp>"And finally, Grawshak. Orc Shaman of the Northern Tribes."</p>
<p>The last of the four Lieutenants, an Orc decorated in skins, feathers
and skulls carrying a massive totem wand growled what might have been a
greeting or a curse at the party.</p>
<p>"I believe that these four Sorcerers will succeed where you so
miserably failed. And it is they who will punish you for your failure.”</p>
<p>With this final word, Morcar disappeared into the shadows. From
here he watched with great satisfaction as his four sorcerous Lieutenants
erased all trace of Festral and his followers.</p>
<p>Morcar smiled. These were indeed the ones who would finally
destroy the Emperor's heroes forever.</p>

each of whom have their own new spell cards which will be used against the
Hero players.</p>
<p>Secondly, to make sure that the Heroes can put up an effective resistance against
these awesome new spells, the pack introduces Men-At-Arms — warriors who
will join the Heroes on their Quests for a share of the spoils.</p>

<img src="Images/Rules/assembly_barriers.jpg"/>
<h1>New Magic</h1>
<h2>The Forces of Morcar</h2>
<p>Wizards of Morcar introduces four powerful new adversaries for the Heroes. Each of these
new opponents is a Sorcerer and has his own set of sorcerous spells which he may use
in the same way as the Wizard and the Elf.</p>
<p>Each Sorcerer has his own special set of six spells which only he may use. For example,
only the Necromancer may use the Necromancer spells and only the Orc Shaman may
use the Orc Shaman spells.</p>
<p>Each Sorcerer may only cast one spellin a turn, instead of attacking. Each spell may
only be used once in each Quest.</p>
<p>Each new Quest starts with a full set of six spells for each Sorcerer in that Quest.</p>
<h2>New Spells for the Emperor’s Heroes</h2>
<p>There are also three new sets of spells for the Wizard and Elf: Spells of Protection, Spells
of Detection and Spells of Darkness. These may be added to the existing sets of spells
which the Elf and Wizard draw on, but they may still only choose one and three sets of
spells respectively. They may still change their spells between Quests.</p>
<h1>Spell Special Effects</h1>
<p>Several of the new spells have special effects which can be displayed on
the board using the special counters on the card sheet. Details of each spell
appear on each spell card while the general rules of effect are detailed below.</p>
<h3>Magical Barriers</h3>
<p>Wall of Ice, Wall of Flame and Wall of Stone spells allow the caster to build a solid
barrier which will appear on the board as a card piece standing on a plastic base.
This barrier may be placed across two squares on the gameboard to form a solid
impassable wall that will remain on the board until it is destroyed. The wall may
resist an attack by rolling the number of defence dice shown on the specific spell
card and counting the white shields scored. If the wall takes one Body point or
more of damage, it is destroyed and the piece is removed from the board.</p>
<h3>Lightning Bolts and Earthquakes</h3>
<p>When a player casts either of these spells, he or she takes the relevant card piece
and places one end in a square in front of the sorcerer and then lays the piece in a
straight line from there. That spell then affects anyone along that line, unless a wall
blocks the way, in which case a Lightning Bolt attack will stop there, attacking only
those in front of the wall.</p>
<p>The Earthquake tile covers 6 squares, each of which counts as a pit trap except that
they are all joined up. Players may move in the normal way along the bottom of the
quake but can only leave it by climbing out onto a clear square adjacent to it.
Figures in the quake area may fight and cast spells as normal but may only do so
with figures inside the quake area.</p>
<p>If an Earthquake meets a wall, that wall is breached and a breached wall token is
placed there. Any figure may move through a breached wall. If a room which has
not been explored is breached, the contents should be laid out at once. If the
Earthquake meets a Magical Wall, both spells are cancelled and the pieces are
removed from the board.</p>
<h3>Magical Traps</h3>
<p>Whenever a character enters a room described in the Quest notes as containing a
magical trap, the Evil Wizard player must refer to the Magic Reference Chart to see
the effect of that particular trap.</p>
<p>Magical traps cannot be found by searching. They can only be disarmed with
certain spells specified on the Magic Reference Chart. Magical traps may only be
activated once. As soon as a magical trap has been activated, players can move safely
through that room or corridor.</p>
<h1>Men-at-Arms</h1>
<p>Once a Hero has become a Champion and his deeds are talked about in \
taverns and around camp fires all over the land, he will want a band of
followers to aid him in even greater feats of heroism.</p>
<p>Such men are found in towns and cities all around the country. Men willing to
follow a great Champion and fight for him as long as he will pay for their upkeep.</p>
<p>There are four types of Men-at-Arms. Each has his own strengths and weaknesses
and each has his own price.</p>
<img src="Images/Cards/pic_menatarms_crossbowman.jpg" style="float: left;filter: grayscale(1);clear: both"/>
<h2>The Crossbowman</h2>
<p>
The Crossbowman has a low number of attack
dice but has the power to make ranged attacks.
This allows him to shoot at monsters who are
waiting behind hidden traps or are too far away
to attack in close combat.</p>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
<img src="Images/Cards/pic_menatarms_swordsman.jpg" style="float: left;filter: grayscale(1);"/>
<h2>The Swordsman</h2>
<p>The Swordsman is a great offensive fighter able
to take on more powerful creatures such as the
Gargoyle, Mummies or Chaos Warriors.
However, he is slow and cannot join in any fast
sorties, although his high defence capability
makes him useful against any massed attacks.</p>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
<img src="Images/Cards/pic_menatarms_scout.jpg" style="float: left;filter: grayscale(1);"/>
<h2>The Scout</h2>
<p>The Scout’s low attack dice reduce his chances
of doing huge amounts of damage to monsters,
but he moves fast and has the ability to search
for and disarm traps.</p>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
<img src="Images/Cards/pic_menatarms_halberdier.jpg" style="float: left;filter: grayscale(1);"/>
<h2>The Halberdier</h2>
<p>The Halberdier has equal attack and defence
capabilities. This and his relatively high
movement capability make him a versatile
companion to take on an adventure.</p>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
<h2>Hiring Men-at-Arms</h2>
<p>Adventurers may each hire up to four followers at any time between Quests. These
followers may be from any of the four types of Men-at-Arms. To hire a Man-at-
Arms, an adventurer must pay the initial Price to Hire which appears on the Man-
at-Arms Card. That Man-at-Arms will then stay with and fight for that Champion
until he, the Man-at-Arms, is killed and as long as he-is paid 10 gold coins at the
end of each Quest. If he is not paid for his services, he will leave and must be paid
his full Price to Hire in order to return.</p>
<p>For each Man-at-Arms a Hero hires, that player should take one Man-at-Arms
figure with the relevant weapon shown on that Man-At-Arms’ Card. He should also
take one Man-at-Arms Card for each of the types he has hired. This details the
statistics of each type of Man-at-Arms. (Note: a number of spare Men-at-Arms cards
have been provided to replace any lost or damaged cards.)
A player whose Champion is killed can choose to continue the quest with the
Champion’s surviving Men-at-Arms. If not, he must remove the Men-at-Arms from
the gameboard.</p>
<p>Example: Thorgrin the Dwarf decides to hire a couple of Men-at-Arms to aid him
on his Quests: one Crossbownan to shoot any targets that they cannot reach on foot
and one Halberdier to act as general extra muscle. This costs Thorgrin 125 gold
coins before he sets out on the Quest, but it will also cost him 20 gold coins at the
end of each Quest, assuming of course that both his Men-at-Arms survive.</p>
<h1>Men-at-Arms in the Game</h1>
<p>Once a player has hired any Men-at-Arms, he can take them with
him on his next Quest. Each player begins the Quest in turn by placing
all his figures on the stairway tile or in any adjacent squares and then takes his turn
before the next player sets up.</p>
<ul>
<li>On their turn, each player moves his hero and then moves all of his Men-at-Arms.</li>
<li>Each Man-at-Arms may move and fight in the same way as the Heroes, using the
movement and combat values printed on the Man-at-Arms Card.</li>
<li>When defending, Men-at-Arms count the white shields.</li>
<li>Men-at-Arms can open closed doors and jump over pit traps.</li>
<li>Men-at-Arms may not search for treasure, use any equipment or treasure cards
and only scouts may search for and attempt to disarm traps.</li>
<li>Any money given to a Man-at-Arms cannot be retrieved, even after his death.</li>
</ul>

<h1>A Message From Mentor</h1>
<p>My friends, I have alarming news. The Emperor
and his army are trapped in Kellar’s Keep, the
underground bastion of the fortress Karak Varn.
This great Dwarven stronghold lies deep within the heart of
the World’s Edge Mountains. The fortress is well defended,
but I fear that time is against us. The Emperor’s army
weakens with starvation while the enemy grows stronger by
the day.</p>
<p>It is up to you, brave Heroes, to rescue the Emperor.
The great book Loretome has revealed much useful information
to me.</p>
<p>Many thousands of years ago, the Dwarves made their
home in the World’s Edge Mountains. With their great
engineering skills, they built vast cities that cut deep into the
rock. The cities were connected by tunnels that stretched for
miles beneath the mountains. On the eastern side of the
mountains, the Dwarves constructed huge fortresses to guard
against the evil legions of Chaos. The greatest of these
fortresses was Karak Varn.</p>
<p>The Dwarves lived for many years in peace, for the
Orcs and Goblins did not dare attack the well-defended
cities. But during this time of peace, the Dwarves became
careless. Their army grew smaller and their guards less
vigilant.</p>
<p>Then came Zargon, the Evil Sorcerer and commander of all
that is evil. Zargon spent years raising a vast army of Orcs,
Goblins and monsters beyond description. When the attack
came, there was no warning. The Dwarves fought with great
valor, but their enemy was too strong. One by one the
fortresses fell. Only Karak Varn held.</p>
<p>Most of the hidden tunnels near Karak Varn have long
been forgotten. However, Loretome has revealed to me a
hidden passage known as Grin’s Crag. This secret walkway
is named after the Dwarf who first discovered it. While searching
for a rich vein of gold, Grin found a narrow footpath running
along the edge of an abyss. He explored beyond and found
himself in the lower caverns of Keller’s Keep. Grin carved a
map onto a stone tablet so that he might find the path
again. He then broke the tablet into pieces and hid the
fragments throughout the Halls of Belorn, ancient chambers
that lie deep beneath the World’s Edge Mountains.</p>
<p>First, you must journey through the Halls of Belorn.
These hallowed halls have been stripped of many of the
riches that once adorned them. Yet a treasure or two may be
found by a Hero with a keen eye. But beware! Orcs and
Goblins now dwell here. You must make them pay dearly for
their trespass.</p>
<p>Even Loretome does not reveal the exact location of
Grin’s Crag. You must find the four pieces of Grin’s stone
map that are scattered throughout the halls. Only then can
you travel the path to Kellar’s Keep and lead the Emperor to
safety.</p>
<p>I shall take you to the Great Gate, but from there you
will be on your own. Good luck, my friends. When you need
my guidance, listen deep within yourselves.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The door opened into the darkness of Kellar's Keep.
From far above came the thunder of battle. The forces of
Zargon were making their final assault. This time
there could be no holding them. The Emperor assembled his
force of Guardian Knights, determined to organise one last line of defense. Then
came the news - a group of Heroes had found a secret passage into Kellar's Keep.
Escape was now possible!</p>
<p>Without hesitation the Emperor ordered his army
to fall back towards the secret passage. The guard would take
the rear and fight their way back to the passage.
Kenaron, the Captian of the Emperor's Guardian Knigths, stod bravely
ate the gate, giving his fellow soldiers and wounded time to escape.</p>
<p>Zargon and his fould forces could not be permitted
to follow. Time and time again the evil Doomguard surged forward,
only to be felled by Kenaron's sword.</p
<p>Zargon watched for a while and smiled wryly at Kenaron's courage
and skill-at-arms. A moment later Zargon's patience was spent.
Kenaron fell before a searing storm of flame that burst against the
gate.</p>
<p>But it was too late. Zargon's warriors howled in anger,
for the escape passage had been destroyed.
The Emperor and his army were safe.</p>
<p>“You have done well, brave Heroes. The Emperor has asked me to
express his gratitude. Each of you will receive 500 gold coins for
your efforts. But do not let victory deceive you. A dark
cloud still hangs over the Empire as the forces of Chaos grow stronger.
I shall look for ways to delay Zargon's advance. For now, rest well my friends.
we might delay Morcar's advance. Rest well my friends.
Once I have consulted Loretome, I shall summon you."</p>

these components in any way that you can imagine. For
example, the stairs could be used to link several levels of a
multi-map Quest.</p>
<h1>Playing Kellar's Keep™</h2>
<p>The Quests in Kellar's Keep are generally
played the same way as the Quests in the Game System.
It is especially important that these Quests <em>be played
in order</em>. As in the Game System, Heroes are returned
to full strength (all Body and Mind Points are restored)
between Quests.</p>
<p>There are a few game play differences in Kellar's Keep:</p>
<h4>1. Starting a Quest</h4>
<p>The Heroes <em>do not</em> start their adventures on the spiral
stairway tile used in the Game System. Often, they enter
through an iron door on the edge of the gameboard. This
door is shown on the Quest map with an arrow pointing
inward toward the gameboard. This door is placed on the
gameboard in its specified location before the Quest begins.
At the start of an adventure, the Heroes line up outside the
door and ask Zargon to open it.</p>
<h4>2. Ending a Quest</h4>
<p>Players may leave the gameboard only by locating the
wooden exit door on the edge of the board, or by the finding
the spiral stairway that exists in one of the Quests. The exit
door is shown on the Quest map with an arrow pointing outward
from the gameboard.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> As with regular doors, an exit door will not be put on
the gameboard by Zargon until a Hero looks down the
appropriate corridor. An exit door is usually opened in the
same way as a regular door, unless specified otherwise in the
Quest notes.</p>
<h4>3. Treasures</h4>
<p>To eliminate conflicts among the Heroes, large gold coin
treasures found in treasure chests should be divided among
all surviving Heros.<p>
<h4>4. New Artifact Cards</h4>
<p>These new cards are found on the inside back cover of this
Quest Book. Cut out the cards from the cover or, if you
prefer, photocopy the inside cover and then cut them out.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fire Ring and the Magical Throwing Dagger:</em> These artifacts
are similar to the artifacts in the Game System. When a
Hero finds one of these artifacts, he should record it on his
Character Sheet. Unlike most artifacts in the Game System,
however, these artifacts must be crossed off a Hero’s
Character Sheet after they are used.</li>
<li><em>Dust of Disappearance:</em> If a handful of this dust is tossed on
any Hero, that Hero may move past any monsters
encountered on his next turn. The dust must be crossed off
the Hero’s Character Sheet after it is used.</li>
<li><em>Spell Scrolls</em> The 8 remaining artifact cards are called spell
scrolls. They are used just like the spell cards in the Game
System. However, a spell scroll can be used by ANY Hero
(not just the Wizard and Elf) who finds one.</li>
When a Hero finds a spell scroll, Zargon should turn all of
the spell scroll cards facedown, mix them up and let the
Hero draw one at random. The Hero should then record
the spell scroll on his Character Sheet and return the scroll
facedown to the scroll deck. After a spell scroll has been
used, it must be crossed off the Hero’s Character Sheet.
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> On his turn, any Hero who has artifacts may give them
to other Heroes.</p>

<h1>A Message From Mentor</h1>
<p>Worthy companions, we must act fast.
f The Witch Lord is not dead! He managed
& to escape to the fallen city of Kalos. Many
years ago, this beautiful city was destroyed by
Zargon and given to the Witch Lord to rule.
Beneath the ruins, he built a great stronghold, for
the light of day was too pure for his foul creatures
to endure. Once the Witch Lord’s strength has fully
returned, he will gather his army of the undead
and attack the Empire. Only Heroes with great
courage dare stand against the Witch Lord. His vile
warriors know no fear and will fight relentlessly
until they are destroyed.</p>
<p>Many days of travel have brought you across
the parched Plains of Death. The journey has been
hard, for the land here is scorched and barren.
Finally, you have reached the great ruins of Kalos.
Throughout your trek, you have felt an uneasy
presence. The Witch Lord has been watching your
progress, awaiting your arrival. As he sits upon the
High Throne of Kalos, he can see all who approach.
No one can escape his gaze.</p>
<p>If the Witch Lord is not stopped soon, he will
be joined by Skulmar, Captain of the Forgotten
Legion and by Kessandria, the Witch Queen. If
these two sit alongside the Witch Lord, it is said
that the bones of all fallen warriors will be summoned
together under the Black Banner.</p>
<p>It is up to you, brave Heroes, to destroy the
Witch Lord once and for all. When you need my
guidance, listen deep within yourselves.</p>
`

outro_rotwl_us = `
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>My friends, we have much to be
thankful for. The Witch Lord has
been defeated and his army of
undead remains asleep under the earth. The
magic that controlled them has now been
weakened. Yet this victory could herald our
downfall if we relax our efforts.</p>
<p>Now that the enemy is weaker, we must
be all the stronger. The minions of the Witch
Lord who escaped will surely seek revenge on
those who defeated their master.</p>
<p>Loretome has shown me that Skulmar,
who we believed to be slain, has escaped from
the ruins of Kalos with many of the Witch Lord’s
most powerful spell books. I fear that it will
not be long before you will have to confront
Skulmar and attempt to end his threat forever.</p>
<p>But for the present you have earned
yourselves a rest. So come, my brave Heroes!
The Emperor awaits you in the Grand Palace.
Tonight you are to be honored for your
incredible feats of heroism.</p>

the door to begin these Quests.</p>
<h4>Wooden Exit Door</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/woodendoor.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/Base/DoorOut_US.png"></img>
<p>In many Quests, this special wooden
door is used to exit the gameboard
at the end of a Quest.</p>
<h4>Deat Mist</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/deathmist.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/ReturnOfTheWitchLord/ReturnOfTheWitchLord.DeathMist_US.png"></img>

<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/ReturnOfTheWitchLord/ReturnOfTheWitchLord.ThroneRoom_US.png"></img>
<p>The large throne room is used by evil
rulers such as the Witch Lord.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The smaller illustrations shown with each component
above are Quest map symbol references. These symbols are
also the exact size needed for the blank "create your own"
Quest map provided in the Game System Quest Book. All
you have to do is photocopy the symbols and cut them out.</p>
<p>When creating your own Quest adventures, you may use
these components in any way that you can imagine.</p>
<h1>Playing Return of the Witch Lord™</h2>
<p>The Quests in Return of the Witch Lord are generally
played the same way as the Quests in the Game System.
It is especially important that these Quests be played
in order. As in the Game System, Heroes are returned
to full strength (all Body and Mind Points are restored)
between Quests.</p>
<p>There are a few game play differences in Return of the
Witch Lord:</p>
<h4>1. Starting a Quest</h4>
<p>The Heroes do not always start their adventures on the spiral
stairway tile used in the Game System. Often, they enter
through an iron door on the edge of the gameboard. This
door is shown on the Quest map with an arrow pointing
inward toward the gameboard. This door is placed on the
gameboard in its specified location before the Quest begins.
At the start of an adventure, the Heroes line up outside the
door and ask Zargon to open it.</p>
<h4>2. Ending a Quest</h4>
<p>Players may only leave the gameboard by locating the
wooden exit door on the edge of the board, or by the finding
the spiral stairway that exists in some of the Quests. The exit
door is shown on the Quest map with an arrow pointing outward
from the gameboard.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> As with regular doors, an exit door will not be put on
the gameboard by Zargon until a Hero looks down the
appropriate corridor. An exit door is usually opened in the
same way as a regular door, unless specified otherwise in the
Quest notes.</p>
<h4>3. Treasures</h4>
<p>To eliminate conflicts among the Heroes, large gold coin
treasures found in treasure chests should be divided among
all surviving Heros.<p>
<h4>4. New Artifact Cards</h4>
<p>These new cards are found on the inside back cover of this
Quest Book. Cut out the cards from the cover or, if you
prefer, photocopy the inside cover and then cut them out.</p>
<p>The following 5 artifact cards are used just like the artifacts
in the Game System. When a Hero finds an artifact, he should
record it on his Character Sheet. Unlike most artifacts in the
Game System, however, some of these artifacts must be
crossed off the Hero’s Character Sheet after they are used.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Magical Throwing Dagger:</em> When thrown at a monster that a
Hero can see, this dagger always hits and inflicts 1 Body
Point of damage. The monster cannot defend. The dagger
must be crossed off the Hero’s Character Sheet after it
is used.</li>
<li><em>Dust of Disappearance:</em> If a handful of this dust is tossed on
any Hero, that Hero may move past any monsters
encountered on his next turn. The dust must be crossed off
the Hero’s Character Sheet after it is used.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New Artifact Cards (continued)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Anti-poison Quill:</em> This rare, hollow quill contains a mysterious
substance that counteracts any type of poison. This
antidote will restore Body Points lost by poisoning if used
immediately by the owner. The quill must be crossed off
the Hero’s Character Sheet after it is used.</li>
<li><em>Rabbit Boots:</em> These magical boots give their wearer a
greater chance to jump over 1 discovered trap <em>per turn</em>. A
Hero can successfully jump a trap by rolling anything but a
black shield on 1 combat die. (However, if a black shield is
rolled, the trap will be sprung, and the Hero will suffer the
body damage caused by that particular type of trap.)</li>
<li><em>Arm Band of Healing:</em> The wearer of this magical arm band
can restore two of his lost Body Points <em>once per Quest</em>. If
the wearer’s Body Points are reduced to zero, this artifact
can be used immediately to restore 2 Body Points as long as
it has not already been used in that Quest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 5 remaining artifact cards on the inside back cover are
spell scrolls. These scrolls are used just like the spell cards in
the Game System. However, a spell scroll can be used by ANY
Hero (not just the Wizard and Elf) who finds one.</p>
<p>When a spell scroll is found, the Hero should record it on
his Character Sheet. After the scroll has been used, it must be
crossed off the Hero’s Character Sheet.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Heroes who have artifacts are allowed to give them to
other Heroes.</p>

<h1>A Message From Mentor</h1>
<p>Welcome, mighty Barbarian, to the land of
your youth! It seems only yesterday that the
tribal elders gave you leave to explore the
many wonders of the warm lands to the south. You
return now as a renowned warrior, tall and strong, well-versed
in the skills of battle.</p>
<p>Happy though your homecoming is, bitter tidings are on
the minds of the tribal elders. They wearily tell you why
you have been summoned back to aid your people in
their time of need.</p>
<p>An ancient evil, long thought banished, has arisen to
threaten the Northlands once more. The Frozen Horror
has burst forth from the icy tomb where it has rested
these last centuries, recovering its strength and awaiting
Zargon’s signal. At last, its master has called it, and the
Frozen Horror has returned to its ancient Seat of Power
deep within Ice Mountain. It has regained the Scepter of
Glacial Majesty, an evil artifact of vast power. As we
speak, the Frozen Horror is reviving its minions and
enacting its plans to cover the Northlands and the
Empire in a shroud of deadly ice.</p>
<p>Your people seek a champion to oppose the evil of the
Frozen Horror. You have been called in hopes that you
might prove to be that champion. To determine your
worthiness, the elders have set before you three
dangerous Quests. These must be undertaken by you
alone. If you survive this test, lead your companions into
the depths of Ice Mountain. There you must find and
destroy the Scepter of Glacial Majesty before it achieves
its full power. Only when the Scepter is no more can you
confront the Frozen Horror and destroy it forever.</p>
<p>You must call upon all your courage and skill, Barbarian!
The greatest perils you have ever faced await within Ice
Mountain. Great, too, is the treasure that will be yours if
you succeed. Among the many riches to be found is the
Amulet of the North, an ancient artifact that is said to
grant its wearer marvelous powers. Good Iuck, mighty
warrior. The fates of many depend on you!</p>
`

outro_fh = `
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Congratulations, mighty
Barbarian! You and your
companions have destroyed the
Frozen Horror, saving the
Empire from an ice-shrouded doom.
Zargon’s plans in the Northlands have
been thwarted, thanks to your cunning,
bravery and skill.</p>
<p>In appreciation of your heroism, the
tribal elders have awarded you and your
fellow Heroes 1,000 gold coins each.</p>
<p>We have won this battle, but we must
remain vigilant. Zargon’s power grows
still. The Frozen Horror returned once
before when the Forces of Good thought
it dead, and it may well return again. For
now, though, the danger has passed.</p>
<p>Your people will sing your praises
forever, Barbarian! Centuries from now,
your descendants may have to find
another champion to defend them
against the agents of Chaos. May they find
a Hero as worthy as you!</p>
<p>Zargon’s plans in other regions remain
unchecked. The Empire is sorely pressed
on many fronts. Soon your services will
be needed again. I fear that many
dangerous tasks still lie ahead of you.</p>
<p>But for tonight, you and your
companions are honored guests at a
great feast. Tales of valor will be told, and
there will be much rejoicing. Come
receive the thanks of your kinsmen!</p>

<h1>Alchemist's Shop</h1>
<h3>Potion of Battle Rage</h3>
<img src="Images/Rules/potionofbattlerage.jpg"></img>
<p><b>Cost: 400 Gold Coins</b></p>
<p>Only the Barbarian can drink this purple-red
concoction. It grants him 2 attacks per turn
as long as there are monsters in sight. As soon
as there are no monsters in the Barbarian's
line of sight, this potion's effect wears off.</p>
<h3>Potion of Rejuvenation</h3>
<img src="Images/Rules/potionofrejuvenation.jpg"></img>
<p><b>Cost: 500 Gold Coins</b></p>
<p>Any Hero who drinks this bright yellow liquid
regains up to 6 lost Body Points. Roll 1 red die
to see how many Body Points the Hero gets
back. This potion cannot give the Hero more
than his starting number of Body Points.</p>
<h3>Potion of Icy Strength</h3>
<img src="Images/Rules/potionoficystrength.jpg"></img>
<p><b>Cost: 200 Gold Coins</b></p>
<p>This bubbling, orange mixture grants the
Barbarian superhuman strength for one turn.
After the Barbarian drinks this potion, his next
attack causes twice as many Body Points of
damage as are rolled on the combat dice. No
other Hero can use this potion.</p>
<h3>Potion of Frost Skin</h3>
<img src="Images/Rules/potionoffrostskin.jpg"></img>
<p><b>Cost: 300 Gold Coins</b></p>
<p>Only the Barbarian is affected by this slushy
drink. It enables the Barbarian to roll 2 extra
combat dice when defending against attacks. As
soon as there are no monsters in the Barbarian’s
line of sight, this potion’s effect wears off.</p>
<p><b>Three of the above potions can be used only
by the Barbarian. Different potions may also
be purchased from the Alchemist’s Shop in
other Quest Packs.</b></p>

<p>The Frozen Horror can cast the following Chaos spells: Chill, Ice Storm,
Ice Wall, Mind Freeze, Skate and Soothe.  Zargon can choose an
additional 6 Chaos spells for the Frozen Horror from any of the Chaos
spells in the Game System, with the exception of the Escape spell.</p>
<p>During Zargon’s turn, each Ice Gremlin can either attack a Hero or
Mercenary, or it can steal one item from one Hero (Zargon's choice).
The item stolen cannot be the armor or shield a Hero is using, nor the
weapon he is wielding.  As soon as an Ice Gremlin has stolen an item, it
runs away at full speed.  The Heroes can chase the Ice Gremlin on their
turn. If they catch it and destroy it, they regain the stolen item. If no
Hero can see the Ice Gremlin at the start of Zargon’s turn, the Ice
Gremlin has escaped with the item.  The item should be crossed off the
Hero's Character Sheet.  Remove the Ice Gremlin figure from the
gameboard.</p>
<p>The Polar Warbear attacks once with its mighty paw and once with its
spiked mace.  Two attacks can be made against one opponent or one
attack can be made against each of two different opponents.</p>
<p>Whenever the Yeti’s attack causes a Hero to lose at least 1 Body Point,
the Yeti grabs the Hero in a powerful hug.  This hug inflicts 2 Body
Points of damage to the Hero at the start of each subsequent Zargon
turn. The Hero cannot defend against this attack, nor can he take any
actions. The Yeti can make no other attacks while hugging.  This
continues until either the Hero dies or the Yeti is killed by the Hero’s
companions.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>The cardboard tiles listed above are two-sided. The front and
back of many tiles are different.</p>
<h3>New Components:</h3>
<h4>Monster Assembly</h4>
<p>The Frozen Horror, Polar Warbear and Yeti require assembly before
they can be used. Assemble these monsters as shown below. There are
also 6 Mercenaries that sometimes serve as monsters. See page 9 for
more about Mercenaries and how to assemble them.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/frozenhorror.jpg"></img>
Frozen Horror
<img src="Images/Rules/polarwarbear.jpg"></img>
Polar Warbear
<img src="Images/Rules/yeti.jpg"></img>
Yeti
<h4>New Monsters</h4>
<p>To learn more about the new monster figures, see the monster
cards that come with this Quest Pack, as well as the Monster Chart
on the back cover of this book.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The new cardboard components are shown below. Next to most
components is a matching Quest map symbol. These symbols appear on
each map to show you where to place components on the gameboard.
For example, the iron entrance door shown below is represented on the
Quest map by the symbol shown to the right of the door.</p>
<p>These symbols are also the exact size needed for the blank, “create your
own” Quest map provided in the Game System Quest Book. All you
have to do is photocopy the symbols and cut them out.</p>
<h4>Door Assembly</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/assembly_inoutdoor_us.jpg"></img>
<p>Take 2 plastic door stands from the Game
System. The 2 new doors in this Quest Pack
should be fitted into the door bases as shown at right.
These doors are described below.</p>
<h4>Iron Entrance Door</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/irondoor.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA//Base/DoorIn_US.png"></img>
<p>This iron door is placed on the edge of the
gameboard in many of the Quests. Heroes
line up outside the iron door to begin these
Quests.</p>
<h4>Wooden Exit Door</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/woodendoor.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/Base/DoorOut_US.png"></img>
<p>In many Quests, this special
wooden door is used to exit the
gameboard at the end of the
Quest.</p>
<h4>Slippery Ice</h4>
<p>Do not place a slippery ice tile
on the gameboard until a Hero
steps on the appropriate square.
Whenever a Hero moves onto a
slippery ice square, the Hero
rolls 1 combat die. If a white
shield is rolled, the Hero falls
and his turn ends immediately.
Any other roll means the Hero
can continue moving (if he has
moves left). The Hero must roll
for each slippery ice square
moved onto. A fallen Hero
cannot take any actions or
defend against attacks until his
next turn. Monsters are not
affected by slippery ice.
A slippery ice square cannot be
found by searching, nor can it
be disarmed. Once it is placed
on the gameboard, it can be
jumped over as a pit.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/slipperyice.jpg"></img>
<p>Four sizes:
1 square
1x2 squares
1x3 squares
2x3 squares</p>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.SlipperyIce1x1_US.png"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.SlipperyIce2x1_US.png"></img>

<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.SlipperyIce3x1_US.png"></img>
<h4>Magic Ice</h4>
<p>These tiles are used with the Ice
Bridge spell scroll and the Ice
Wall Chaos spell.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/magicice.jpg"></img>
<h4>Ice Ledge</h4>
<p>This slippery ledge surrounds a deep crevasse in the icy mountain.
The Heroes must walk around the crevasse on the ledge, inches from
a fall to the death.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/iceledge.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.IceLedge_US.png"></img>
<h4>Ice Vault</h4>
<p>This frigid room drains heat from Heroes. For each turn in which a
Hero enters or remains in this room, the Hero rolls 1 combat die. He
loses 1 Body Point if he rolls a skull. Monsters are not affected by the
heat-draining property of this room.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/icevault.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.IceVault2x3_US.png"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.IceVault3x4_US.png"></img>
<p>Two sizes:
2x3 squares
3x4 squares</p>
<h4>Ice Tunnels</h4>
<p>A pair of tunnel entrances
connect two apparently
unconnected rooms via an
unseen tunnel. Any Hero or
monster landing on one of
these entrances immediately
moves to the other entrance.
After moving from one
tunnel entrance to the other,
the Hero’s or monster’s turn
is over.</p> 
<img src="Images/Rules/icetunnels.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.IceTunnelA_US.png"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.IceTunnelA_US.png"></img>

<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.IceTunnelC_US.png"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.IceTunnelC_US.png"></img>
<h4>Ice Slide</h4>
<p>Do not place the ice slide tile on the gameboard until a Hero steps on
the first square of the slide. Any Hero who does step onto this slippery
chute of ice is whisked away in the direction indicated by the arrow.
The Hero immediately moves to the last square of the slide. (More than
one Hero may occupy the exit square.) This ends the Hero’s turn.</p>
<p>The slide is hidden and it cannot be searched for as a trap, nor can it be
disarmed. When a Hero slips down an ice slide, he rolls 1 combat die.
He loses 1 Body Point if he rolls a white shield. Monsters cannot move
onto ice slide squares. Heroes cannot climb up an ice slide in the
direction opposite to that indicated by the arrow.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/iceslide.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.IceSlide_US.png"></img>
<h4>Ice Cave Entrance</h4>
<p>This special tile is used as an entrance or exit.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/icecaveentrance.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.IceCaveEntrance_US.png"></img>
<h4>Scepter Room</h4>
<p>The Frozen Horror has hidden the Scepter of Glacial Majesty, an
artifact of great power, in this room.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/scepterroom.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.ScepterRoom_US.png"></img>
<h4>Crystal Key Tile</h4>
<p>Use this magical key to open the door to the Seat of Power
Room, where the Frozen Horror awaits.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/crystalkeytile.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.CrystalKey_US.png"></img>
<h4>Living Fog Room</h4>
<p>This room is filled with an eerie, swirling fog. Monsters seem to
appear on all sides of the Heroes, only to disappear into the fog when
attacked.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/livingfogroom.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.LivingFogRoom_US.png"></img>
<h4>Cage Room</h4>
<p>This room serves as a prison for servants who have displeased the
Frozen Horror.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/cageroom.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.CageRoom_US.png"></img>
<h4>Bottomless Chams Room</h4>
<p>The crevasse that divides this room can be jumped over as a pit, but
any Hero who falls into it is lost “forever.”</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/bottomlesschasmroom.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.BottomlessChasm_US.png"></img>
<h4>Frozen Crypt Room</h4>
<p>Monstrous servants of the Frozen Horror are encased in thick ice
within this room. These monsters are freed when a Hero opens the
appropriate door.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/frozencryptroom.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.FrozenCryptRoom_US.png"></img>
<h4>Ice Gremlin Treasure Room</h4>
<p>Ice Gremlins steal anything they can get their cold hands on. Their
booty is all stored in this room.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/icegremlintreasureroom.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.IceGremlinTreasureRoom_US.png"></img>
<h4>The Seat of Power Room</h4>
<p>The Frozen Horror rules from this room, devising evil plans for the
conquest of the Empire.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/theseatofpowerroom.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.SeatOfPower_US.png"></img>
<h4>Icy River</h4>
<p>Each square of these underground streams counts as 2 squares for
movement purposes. Each time a Hero enters an icy river square, he
rolls 1 combat die. He loses 1 Body Point to the cold if he rolls a
white shield. Monsters suffer neither movement penalties nor
damage from the icy river.</p>
<p>Two sizes:
1x3 squares
1x8 squares</p>

<h1>Playing the Barbarian Quest Pack</h1>
<p>These ten new Quests are generally played the same way as the
Quests in the Game System. As in the Game System, Heroes are
returned to full strength between Quests. (All Body and Mind Points
are restored.)</p>
<p>There are a few gameplay differences in the Barbarian Quest Pack.</p>
<h4>1. The Quests</h4>
<p>The first three Quests are solo adventures, designed for play by a
Barbarian alone. These can be used as an introduction to Hero
Quest for a new player or as fun Quests to play when only two
players are available. Also, if a new Barbarian is to join a party of
experienced characters, these three Quests will enable the Barbarian
to catch up with the other Heroes by gaining gold, equipment and
magical items.</p>
<p>The next five Quests are all group Quests. The last two Quests are
also group Quests, but they are played as a single, double-sized
Quest, as the Heroes must cross between the two Quests to achieve
ultimate victory.</p>
<h4>Female Barbarian</h4>
<p>This Quest Pack includes a figure for a female
Barbarian. Her statistics are the same as the male
Barbarian in the Game System. She can be used to
replace the male Barbarian figure, if the player
prefers to play a female character. Any reference to
“Barbarian” in Quest Packs also applies to the
female Barbarian. A group of Heroes can contain
only one Barbarian at a time.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/femalebarbarian.jpg"></img>
<h4>3. Starting and Ending a Quest</h4>
<p>The Heroes do not always start and end their Quests on the spiral
stairway. The message from Mentor at the beginning of each Quest
tells where the Heroes start and end the Quest. When there is an
iron entry or wooden exit door, it is indicated on the Quest map by
an arrow (pointing into the gameboard for the entry door, and out
of the gameboard for the exit door). When there is an entry door, it
is always placed on the gameboard in its specified location before
each Quest begins. At the start of an adventure, the Heroes line up
outside the door and ask Zargon to open it.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> As with a regular door, an exit door is not placed on the
gameboard by Zargon until a Hero looks down the appropriate
corridor.</p>
<h4>4. Mind Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>When a Hero reaches zero Mind Points, he is not dead but in
<em>shock</em>. (A Hero cannot go below zero Mind Points.) He rolls only 1
red die to move, attacks with only 1 combat die, and defends with
only 2 combat dice. (Armor, weapons and most artifacts do not
increase the attack or defend dice when a Hero is in shock.) The
Hero’s attack and defend dice can be temporarily increased by some
spells and spell scrolls.</li>
<li>The extra Mind Points gained from certain artifacts (such as the
Talisman of Lore), can be lost in battle. For example, a Barbarian
with the Talisman of Lore (for a total of 3 Mind Points) goes into
shock after he accumulates 3 Mind Points of damage.</li>
<li>In this and other Quest Packs, it is important to keep track of
Heroes’ current Mind Points. Tell the players to use the bottom row
of “Body Point” boxes on their Character Sheets to record Mind
Point damage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Rule Clarifications</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Passing Items:</em> A Hero can pass a potion, artifact, weapon, or any
other item to another Hero only if the 2 Heroes are in adjacent
squares and neither Hero is adjacent to a monster.</li>
<li><em>Spiral Stairway:</em> During a Quest, if a Hero stands on a spiral
stairway and attacks monsters, the monsters can attack back on
Zargon’s turn. When a spiral stairway is used as the exit at the end
of a Quest, any Hero who moves onto that spiral stairway is
immediately removed from the gameboard.</li>
<li><em>Multiple Attacks:</em> A Hero rolls defend dice once for each attacking
monster. For example, a Hero attacked by 3 Zombies gets 3 separate
defend rolls. A Hero attacked by a monster with multiple attacks
(such as the Polar Warbear), however, gets only 1 defend roll against
that monster per turn, no matter how many of the monster's attacks
are directed at the Hero.</li>
</ul>
<h4>6. Wandering Monsters</h4>
<p>Several Quests in this Quest Pack have multiple wandering
monsters. These monsters may appear if a Hero draws a Wandering
Monster card from the Treasure card deck or if a Hero moves onto
a Wandering Monster trap as described above right. For example,
when the Quest notes say, “Wandering monsters in this Quest:
3 Goblins,” place 3 Goblins adjacent to the Hero who initiated the
wandering monster encounter. If fewer than 3 adjacent squares are
available, place the remaining monsters as close to the Hero as
possible.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you run out of the monsters called for, substitute other
monsters of similar strength.</p>
<h4>7. New Traps</h4>
<p>The Wandering Monster trap, the Stalactite trap and the Swinging Axe
trap do not have tiles.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.WanderingMonster_US.png"></img>
<em>Wandering Monster Trap:</em> When a Hero moves onto a square
with the trap symbol shown at left, tell the player that the
Hero must stop on that square. The monster or monsters
listed as wandering monsters for that Quest appear on any
square or squares adjacent to the Hero or as close as
possible. The monsters immediately attack and the Hero
defends. (If the Hero has not already taken an action that
turn, he may do so after he defends.) Otherwise the turn
passes to the next player (or to Zargon). Each Wandering
Monster trap can be activated only once. Monsters cannot
activate it. Ignore the trap after the first time a Hero springs
it. Wandering Monster traps are so well concealed that they
are not detected when a Hero searches for traps.</li>
<li>
<img style="background: #fe6601" src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.Stalactite_US.png"></img>
<em>Stalactite Trap:</em> This deadly spear of ice clings to the ceiling
of ice caverns. Unless searched for and disarmed, the
stalactite falls upon the first Hero to move onto the trap
square, causing 1 Body Point of damage. Monsters do not
spring Stalactite traps.</li>
<li>
<img style="background: #fe6601" src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.SwingingAxe_US.png"></img>
<em>Swinging Axe Trap:</em> When a Hero moves onto this square,
a huge axe swings out from a hidden alcove in the ceiling.
The Hero then rolls 2 combat dice and loses 1 Body Point
for each skull rolled. The Hero does not get to roll defend
dice. A Swinging Axe trap can be searched for and disarmed.
Until it is disarmed, a Swinging Axe trap affects every Hero
who steps onto the square. Monsters do not spring
Swinging Axe traps.</li>
</ul>
<h4>8. Large Monsters</h4>
<p>When a monster takes up more than one square (the Frozen Horror
in this Quest Pack, for instance), that monster can attack anyone on
any adjacent square (including diagonally), even if the monster’s
figure is facing away from the target.</p>
<h4>9. Selling Excess Items</h4>
<p>As the Heroes gain better equipment, they can sell some of their old
items to the Armory. Only items that are listed for sale in the
Armory (on the cardboard platform in the Game System) can be sold
back to the Armory. The Hero receives gold coins equal to half of the
Armory’s price when selling items to the Armory. Thus a Hero who
sells a longsword (which costs 350 gold coins) back to the Armory
receives 175 gold coins. Items sold at the Armory for odd sums (the
dagger at 25 gold coins, for example) can be sold back for half price,
rounded down (12 gold coins for the dagger).</p>
<h4>10. Treasure</h4>
<p>To eliminate conflicts among the Heroes, large gold coin treasures
found in treasure chests should be divided among all surviving
Heroes.</p>
<h4>11. New Treasure Cards</h4>
<p>The 6 new treasure cards should be mixed into the Game System’s
deck of treasure cards before play begins. Draw from this deck when
a Hero searches for treasure.</p>
<h4>12. New Artifact Cards</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Amulet of the North, Ring of Warmth and Snowshoes of Speed:</em>
These artifacts are similar to the artifacts in the Game System. When
a Hero finds one of these artifacts, he should record it on his
Character Sheet.</li>
<li><em>Spell Scrolls:</em> Six of the artifact cards in this Quest Pack are spell
scrolls. These are used just like the spell cards in the Game System.
However, a spell scroll can be used by ANY Hero (not just the Wizard
and Elf) who finds one. Note that spell scrolls can be used only once.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a Hero finds an unnamed spell scroll, Zargon should turn all
of the spell scroll cards in this Quest Pack facedown, mix them up,
and let the Hero draw one at random. The Hero should then record
the spell scroll on his Character Sheet and return the scroll card to
the scroll deck. After a spell scroll has been used, it must be crossed
off the Hero’s Character Sheet.</p>
<h4>13. Mercenaries</h4>
<p>This Quest Pack contains 6 Mercenary figures, with 12
interchangeable weapons that enable you to put together the 4
different types of Mercenaries (the Scout, the Swordsman, the
Crossbowman and the Halberdier).</p>
<p><em>In some Quests, Mercenaries serve as evil monsters who oppose
the Heroes.</em> Whenever a Mercenary is shown on a Quest map, it
should be considered a monster controlled by Zargon.</p>
<p>Mercenaries are also soldiers who can be hired by a Hero before a
Quest begins. They will accompany any Hero on a Quest, if the
Hero pays their fee. The fee for each type of Mercenary is given on
the Mercenary’s card, as well as on the Mercenaries Chart on page
33 of this book. The gold must be paid before the Quest begins.
Mercenaries may be hired for any group Quest in this Quest Pack,
but not for the solo Quests.</p>
<p>A Mercenary is controlled by the Hero who hired him. The
Mercenary moves and attacks immediately after that Hero’s turn.
A Hero can control as many Mercenaries as he can afford to hire.
A Mercenary can move, open doors, attack and defend as a Hero, but
he can take no other actions (except for the Scout, who can search
for and disarm traps). A Mercenary does not receive any treasure. If
a Hero dies on a Quest, any Mercenary hired by that Hero continues
on the Quest, controlled by the fallen Hero’s player.</p>
<p>The Scout, Swordsman, Crossbowman and Halberdier each have
different statistics and abilities. These are detailed on the cards
that come in this Quest Pack, as well as on the Mercenaries Chart
on page 33 of this book.</p>
<p>If a Quest map calls for a type of Mercenary that is not available
because they've all been hired by Heroes, Zargon may substitute
a different type of Mercenary, or another monster altogether.</p>

<p><b>Zargon, study this book carefully! Although it is your
guide to running these adventures, it may not answer
every question you have during play. When in doubt, use
your experience and imagination to make the best choice.
Remember that you are the ultimate authority in your
HERO QUEST world!</b></p>
<h1>Quest Map Guide</h1>
<p>The Quest map symbols are color-coded to help you guide the Heroes through these Quests. Here’s
what the various map symbol colors mean.</p>
<ul>
<li style="overflow: auto"><div width="10px" height="10px" style="background: #fe6601; float: left; width: 30px; height: 30px"></div>Gold: This color is used to highlight traps that the Heroes can detect by searching.</li>
<li style="overflow:auto"><div width="10px" height="10px" style="background: #a8c5ba; float: left; width: 30px; height: 30px"></div>Light Green: This color is used to highlight traps and other hazards that the Heroes
can neither see nor detect by searching.</li>
<li style="overflow:auto"><div width="10px" height="10px" style="background: #003928; float: left; width: 30px; height: 30px"></div>Dark Green: This color is used to highlight monster symbols. See the Monster Chart
on the back cover for actual symbols.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>In each Quest, notes prefaced with a capital letter correspond to a matching letter location on
the Quest map. Remember that Mercenaries cannot be hired in Quests 1-3.</p>

<h1>A Message From Mentor</h1>
<p>Ah, you're here at last, my Elven friend. Our
time together must be brief, for your skills
are needed urgently. The Elven kingdom is in
turmoil, as you may have heard. Queen
Terrellia’s five-year-old daughter, Millandriell, has been
kidnapped. The Queen has secretly informed me that she
has received a ransom note from her evil sister, the
Archmage Sinestra. Sinestra has always been vain and
proud, paying more attention to her mirrors than to the
advice of the wise. Her vanity has led her to a diabolical
plan. The note demands that the Queen abdicate the
throne and turn all power over to Sinestra. Only then will
Millandriell be returned unharmed.</p>
<p>The Queen has asked me to find an Elven Hero who has
the strength and courage to lead a small band of Heroes
into Sinestra’s stronghold to rescue Millandriell. Because
the girl’s life would be forfeit if such a rescue mission
failed, Queen Terrellia insists that the chosen Hero first
prove his worth. The Queen has decided upon three
Quests for this Elf to undertake on his own before she will
agree to the rescue attempt.</p>
<p>I have chosen you to lead the rescue party. If you survive
the three solo Quests the Queen proposes, your heroic
companions will rejoin you and you will all embark on the
mission to rescue Princess Millandriell.</p>
<p>You must succeed in this mission, for your entire race is
in danger should Sinestra gain the throne. The safety of
the Empire is also at stake, if what I fear is true. I suspect
that Zargon is lurking behind Sinestra’s schemes. As a
willing servant of Zargon, she may call upon the forces
of Chaos to thwart your mission.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate the importance of the tasks before
you, brave Elf. If you fail, the Emperor will lose the power
and strength of the Elven people to Zargon. That will surely
mean the end of the Empire!</p>
`

outro_motm = `
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Fearless Heroes, a great celebration is
about to be held in your honor. Queen
Terrellia wishes to thank you for rescuing
the Princess of the Elven people from a
horrible fate.</p>
<p>Because of your valiant efforts, peace and order have
been restored to the kingdom. You have ended a dire
threat to the Elven people, at great risk to yourselves.
You fought a mighty battle against the forces of Chaos
and emerged victorious.</p>
<p>Queen Terrellia has decreed that your names be written
down in the ancient Book of Elven Heroes, for your deeds
have truly earned you a place among the most famous in
their long history. Your names shall become synonymous
with heroism and justice. Legends and songs will praise
you for as long as Elves have voices to tell of your deeds.</p>
<p>The Queen is also thankful that you have returned the
sacred Elven Bow of Vindication. As a token of her kingdom's
gratitude, she has asked me to give you this ancient
chest. Inside, you will find 2,000 gold coins. Take this
treasure and divide it among you.</p>
<p>Go now, and join in the celebration. Until we meet again,
take care my friends.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The cardboard tiles listed above are two-sided. The front and
back of many tiles are different.</p>
<h3>New Components:</h3>
<h4>Monster Assembly</h4>
<p>The Archmage and Ogres require assembly before they can be used.
Assemble these monsters as shown below.</p>
<img src="Images/Rules/assembly_archmage.jpg"></img>
Archmage
<img src="Images/Rules/assembly_ogre_us.jpg"></img>
Ogre
<p>Take the front half of the Ogre and place
the left and right arms into the shoulder
sockets. Next, push the back of the Ogre
into place, squeezing firmly. Finally,
push the Ogre's head into its socket.</p>
<h4>New Monsters</h4>
<p>To learn more about the new monster figures, see the Monster
cards in this Quest Pack as well as the Monster Chart on the inside
back cover of this book.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The new cardboard components are shown here and on
the following pages. Next to most components is a matching
Quest map symbol. These symbols appear on each map to show
you where to place components on the gameboard. For example,
the iron entrance door shown below is represented on the
Quest map by the symbol shown to the right of the door.</p>
<p>These symbols are also the exact size needed for the blank,
“create your own” Quest map provided in the Game System
Quest Book. All you have to do is photocopy the symbols and
cut them out.</p>
<h4>Door Assembly</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/assembly_inoutdoor_us.jpg"></img>
<p>Take 2 plastic door stands from the Game
System. The 2 new doors in this Quest Pack
should be fitted into the bases as shown.
These doors are described above right.</p>
<h4>Iron Entrance Door</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/irondoor.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA//Base/DoorIn_US.png"></img>
<p>This iron door is placed on the edge of the
gameboard in many of the Quests. Heroes
line up outside the door to begin these
Quests. In some Quests, this door also
serves as an exit door.</p>
<h4>Wooden Exit Door</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/woodendoor.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/Base/DoorOut_US.png"></img>
<p>In many Quests, this special
wooden door is used to exit the
gameboard at the end of the
Quest.</p>
<h4>Trap Doors</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/trapdoor.jpg"></img>
<img src="Images/Rules/trapdoor.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheMageOfTheMirror/TheMageOfTheMirror.TrapDoor_US.png"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheMageOfTheMirror/TheMageOfTheMirror.TrapDoor_US.png"></img>
<p>The two trap doors link
apparently unconnected
rooms via an unseen tunnel.
When a Hero or
monster steps on a trap
door square, he moves
instantly to the other
trap door square.</p>
<h4>Sky Orb and Sky Orb Tokens</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/skyorb.jpg"></img>
<img src="Images/Rules/skyorbtokens.jpg"></img>
<p>This artifact is a mystical crystal
orb that protects the Hero who is
carrying it from Mind Point damage.
It can absorb up to 4 Mind
Points of damage before it becomes
useless. When a Hero finds
the Sky Orb, he takes it and the 4
Sky Orb tokens. Whenever the
Hero suffers Mind Point damage,
he gives up one Sky Orb token for each Mind Point of
damage. (Give up the token with 4 points of light first,
then the one with 3 points, etc.) When the Hero has no
more tokens, the Sky Orb is useless.</p>
<h4>Mirrors</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/mirrorbow.jpg"></img>
<img src="Images/Rules/mirrorprincess.jpg"></img>
<p>These stand-up mirrors are secret Room
portals that lead to great treasure
and hidden rooms. Fit these into
the plastic door stands from the
Game System when they are
called for in a Quest.</p>
<h4>Inner Sanctum and Sanctum Wall</h4>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheMageOfTheMirror/TheMageOfTheMirror.InnerSanctum_US.png"></img>
<img src="Images/Rules/sanctum.jpg"></img>
<p>This room is the Archmage Sinestra’s
center of power, the room from which
she commands her minions to carry
out her evil plans. The wall should be
erected at the back of the sanctum, as
shown below.</p>
<p>When a Hero has opened the appropriate door, place the sanctum room and
wall on the gameboard as shown.</p>
<h4>Quicksand</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/quicksand.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheMageOfTheMirror/TheMageOfTheMirror.Quicksand_US.png"></img>
<p>This area contains a bottomless pit filled with quicksand that threatens
to suck in careless or unlucky Heroes.</p>
<h4>Moonsilver Flask</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/moonsilver.jpg"></img>
<p>The glittering, silver liquid in this flask is
the only means of opening a mirror entry
into the Realm of Reflection, where
Princess Millandriell is held captive. Only
the Prospector can identify true
Moonsilver.</p>
<h4>Long Pit Trap</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/longpittrap.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheMageOfTheMirror/TheMageOfTheMirror.LongPitTrap_US.png"></img>
<p>If a Hero wants to jump over this pit the long way, he must have at
least 3 squares of movement left after he moves next to the pit. The
Hero then rolls 1 combat die. A black shield means the Hero has
jumped across safely, using up 3 squares of movement. The Hero can
continue to move if he has more movement left. Any result other
than a black shield means the Hero falls into the pit, suffering 2
Body Points of damage. The Hero must roll a 5 or 6 on a red die on a
subsequent turn to climb out of the pit. While in the pit, the Hero
rolls 1 less combat die when attacking or defending (but never less
than 1 die).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> These traps can be jumped the short way, the same as regular
pit traps.</p>
<h4>Weapon Packs</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/weaponspacks.jpg"></img>
<p>These tiles represent
weapons and other items
dropped by the Heroes
when they are transformed
into Wolves.</p>
<h4>Wolf Tokens</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/wolftoken.jpg"></img>
<p>These represent Heroes in Wolf form.</p>
<h4>Prospector</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/prospector.jpg"></img>
<p>This tile represents the old Prospector who
appears in several Quests. The Prospector’s tile
is given to the Hero who finds him.</p>
<h4>Portcullis</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/portcullis.jpg"></img>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheMageOfTheMirror/TheMageOfTheMirror.Portcullis_US.png"></img>
<p>Some of these massive iron gates open when the Heroes spring a
certain trap, while others are unlocked by the brass key or forced up
by brute strength. Heroes and Monsters <em>cannot</em> “see” through a
portcullis until it is opened.</p>
<h4>Brass Key</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/brasskey.jpg"></img>
<p>This key is used to open a portcullis in several Quests. The brass key
tile is given to the Hero who finds the key.</p>
<h4>Princess Millandriell</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/princess.jpg"></img>
<p>This tile represents the kidnapped daughter of Queen Terrellia.
Princess Millandriell’s tile is given to the Hero who first finds her.</p>
<h2>Playing the Elf Quest Pack</h2>
<p>These ten new Quests are generally played the same way as the Quests
in the Game System. As in the Game System, Heroes are returned to
full strength between Quests. (All Body and Mind Points are restored.)</p>
<p>There are a few gameplay differences in the Elf Quest Pack.</p>
<h4>1. The Quests</h4>
<p>The first three Quests are solo adventures, designed for play by an Elf
alone. These can be used as an introduction to Hero Quest for a new
player or as fun Quests to play when only two players are available.
Also, if a new Elf is to join a party of experienced characters, these
three Quests will enable the Elf to catch up with the other Heroes by
gaining gold, equipment and magical items.</p>
<p>The next five Quests are all group Quests. The last two Quests are also
group Quests, but they are played as a single, double-sized Quest, as the
Heroes must cross between the two Quests to achieve ultimate victory.</p>
<h4>2. Female Elf</h4>
<img src="Images/Rules/femaleelf.jpg"></img>
<p>This Quest Pack includes a figure for a female Elf. Her
statistics are the same as the Elf in the Game System.
She can be used to replace the male Elf, if the player
prefers to play a female character. Any reference to
“Elf” in Quest Packs also applies to the female Elf. <em>A
group of Heroes can contain only one Elf at a time.</em></p>
<h4>3. Starting and Ending a Quest</h4>
<p>The Heroes do not always start and end their Quests on the spiral
stairway. The message from Mentor at the beginning of each Quest
tells where the Heroes start and end the Quest. When there is an iron
entry or wooden exit door, it is indicated on the Quest map by an
arrow (pointing into the map for the entry door, and out of the map
for the exit door). When there is an entry door, it is always placed on
the gameboard in its specified location before each Quest begins. At
the start of an adventure, the Heroes line up outside the door and ask
Zargon to open it.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> As with regular doors, an exit door is not placed on the gameboard
by Zargon until a Hero looks down the appropriate corridor.</p>
<h4>4. Mind Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>When a Hero reaches zero Mind Points, he is not dead but in <em>shock</em>.
(A Hero cannot go below zero Mind Points.) He rolls only 1 red die to
move, attacks with only 1 combat die, and defends with only 2 combat
dice. (Armor, weapons and most artifacts do <em>not</em> increase the attack or
defend dice when a Hero is in shock.) The Hero’s attack and defend
dice can be temporarily increased by some spells and spell scrolls.</li>
<li>The extra Mind Points gained from certain artifacts (such as the
Talisman of Lore) <em>can</em> be lost in battle. For example, a Barbarian with
the Talisman of Lore (for a total of 3 Mind Points) goes into shock after
he accumulates 3 Mind Points of damage.</li>
<li>In this and other Quest Packs, it is important to keep track of
Heroes’ current Mind Points. Tell the players to use the bottom row
of “Body Point” boxes on their Character Sheets to record Mind
Point damage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. New Spell System</h4>
<p>The Elven spell cards introduced in this Quest Pack are a new spell
group for the <em>Elf's use only</em>. The Elf may choose either this spell group
or any other after the Wizard chooses his first spell group. If the Elf
does not choose the new Elven spell cards, they are removed from play.</p>
<p>If the Elf does choose the new Elven spell cards, he must pick only 3 of
the 8 Elven spells to use in each Quest.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Wizard can choose a total of 3 spell groups. The remaining
group(s) of spell cards are removed from play.</p>
<h4>6. Rule Clarifications</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Passing Items:</em> A Hero can pass a potion, artifact, weapon, or any
other item to another Hero only if the 2 Heroes are in adjacent
squares and neither Hero is adjacent to a monster.</li>
<li><em>Spiral Stairway:</em> During a Quest, if a Hero stands on a spiral stairway
and attacks monsters, the monsters can attack back on Zargon's turn.
When a spiral stairway is used as the exit at the end of a Quest, any
Hero who moves onto that spiral stairway is immediately removed
from the gameboard.</li>
</ul>
<h4>7. Wandering Monsters</h4>
<p>Several Quests in this Quest Pack have multiple wandering monsters.
These monsters may appear if a Hero draws a Wandering Monster card
from the Treasure card deck or if a Hero moves onto a Wandering
Monster trap as described above right. For example, if the Quest notes
say, “Wandering Monsters in this Quest: 3 Goblins,” place 3 Goblins
adjacent to the Hero who initiated the wandering monster encounter.
If fewer than 3 adjacent squares are available, place the remaining
monsters as close to the Hero as possible.</p>
<h4>8. New Wandering Monster Trap</h4>
<img src="Icons/Raster/USA/TheFrozenHorror/TheFrozenHorror.WanderingMonster_US.png"></img>
<p>When a Hero moves onto a square with the trap symbol
shown at right, tell the player that the Hero must
stop on that square. The monster or monsters listed
as wandering monsters for that Quest appear on any
square or squares adjacent to the Hero or as close as
possible. The monsters immediately attack and the Hero defends. (If
the Hero has not already taken an action that turn, he may do so after
he defends.) Otherwise the turn passes to the next player (or to
Zargon). Each wandering monster trap can be activated only once.
Monsters cannot activate it. Ignore the trap after the first time a Hero
springs it. Wandering monster traps are so well concealed that they
are not detected when a Hero searches for traps. There are no tiles for
wandering monster traps.</p>
<h4>9. Large Monsters</h4>
<p>When a monster takes up more than one square (the Giant Wolf in
this Quest Pack, for instance), that monster can attack anyone in any
adjacent square (including diagonally), even if the monster’s figure is
facing away from the target.</p>
<h4>10. Selling Excess Items</h4>
<p>As the Heroes gain better equipment, they can sell some of their old
items to the Armory. Only items that are listed for sale in the Armory
(on the cardboard platform in the Game System) can be sold back to
the Armory. The Hero receives gold coins equal to half of the Armory’s
price when selling items to the Armory. Thus, a Hero who sells a
longsword (which costs 350 gold coins) back to the Armory receives
175 gold coins. Items sold at the Armory for odd sums (the dagger at
25 gold coins, for example) can be sold back for half price, rounded
down (12 gold coins for the dagger).</p>
<h4>11. Treasure</h4>
<p>To eliminate conflicts among the Heroes, large gold coin treasures
found in treasure chests should be divided among all surviving Heroes.</p>
<h4>12. New Artifact Cards</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Elven Boots, Elven Bracers, Elven Bow of Vindication, Bone Wand,
Ancient Staff and Sky Orb:</em> These artifacts are similar to the artifacts in
the Game System. When a Hero finds one of these artifacts, he should
record it on his Character Sheet.</li>
<li><em>Spell Scroll:</em> The Treasure Without Doom artifact card in this Quest Pack
is a spell scroll. It is used just like the spell cards in the Game System.
However, a spell scroll can be used by ANY Hero (not just the Wizard and
Elf) who finds one. Note that a spell scroll can be used only once.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hero should record the spell scroll on his Character Sheet and return
the scroll to the deck. After a spell scroll has been used, it must be crossed
off the Hero’s Character Sheet.</p>
<h4>13. New Treasure Cards</h4>
<p>The 4 new treasure cards should be mixed into the Game System’s deck
of treasure cards before play begins. Draw from this deck when a Hero
searches for treasure.</p>
<h4>14. Turning Heroes into Werewolves</h4>
<p>In Quest 7, the Heroes may meet Werewolves. Use the Giant Wolf figures
for these accursed monsters.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Giant Wolves are considered Werewolves only in Quest 7.</p>
<p>If a Hero is affected by a Werewolf’s Curse spell or injured by the attack
of a Werewolf, the Hero becomes a Werewolf, cursed to switch between
Hero form and Wolf form. At the start of every turn, the Hero must roll 2
red dice to see if he transforms into a Wolf. A roll of 2 through 9 means
the Hero remains in Hero form and under the control of the player; the
Hero may move and act normally. A roll of 10 through 12 means the
Hero transforms into Wolf form and Zargon controls him as a monster
for 1 turn (on Zargon’s next turn).</p>
<p>When a Hero transforms into a Wolf, replace his figure with a Wolf tile.
All of his possessions are left in the square in which he transformed. Place
a Weapon Pack tile in the square to represent the Hero’s former possessions.
The Weapon Pack tile stays on this space until the Hero returns to
pick up his possessions. (Monsters cannot take the Weapon Pack.)</p>
<p>This Wolf is a true monster, with no Hero abilities and all the abilities of
monsters (moves on Zargon’s turn, attacks as a Giant Wolf, unaffected
by traps or pits, cannot open doors, etc.).</p>
<p>At the end of Zargon’s turn, the Wolf transforms back into the Hero and
returns to the player's control. The Hero figure replaces the Wolf tile.</p>
<p>The Hero must roll for this transformation each turn until he is cured by
drinking a Wolfsbane Potion (or the Potion of Restoration from the
Alchemist’s Shop).</p>
<h4>15. Elven Archers</h4>
<p>These monsters appear in several Quests and are under Zargon’s control.
Elven Archers may attack with 4 combat dice against any non-adjacent
target in their line of sight. They attack with only 1 combat die if the target
is adjacent. If an Elven Archer's bow becomes warped (from the Twist
Wood spell, for instance), he rolls only 1 combat die to attack.<y/p>
<p>The Elven Archer’s statistics are detailed on the cards that come in this
Quest Pack, as well as in the Monster Chart on the inside back cover of
this book.</p>
