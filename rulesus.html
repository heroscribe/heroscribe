<h1>Hero Quest</h1>
<h1>Instruction Booklet</h1>
<p>Heed well my words, for I am Mentor, Guardian of Loretome. I will tell you of times past, of darker days when the Empire was saved against all hope. For I fear the darkness is about to return. . .</p>
<p>The sinister forces of Zargon, the Evil Sorcerer, had swept all before them. At the sight of the Black Banner and the massed hordes of Chaos, even the bravest warriors of the Emperor had fled, the land was laid to waste and all men despaired.</p>
<p>There then came a mighty warrior Prince from the Borderlands—Rogar the Barbarian. He bore a glittering diamond on his brow—the Star of the West. Hope returned and men flocked to his standard, leaving their hiding places in the hills and forests. Other great Heroes joined him: Durgin, the fearless Dwarven warrior from the World's Edge Mountains, Ladril the Elven fighter mage from distant  Athelorn, and Telor the Wizard whose sorcery was to save Rogar on many occasions.</p>
<p>For many years Rogar trained his army, being careful to avoid open battle with Zargon's general until all was ready. He ever harried the Chaos supply lines and wiped out countless Orcs and Goblins.</p>
<p>Then came the day for which Rogar had waited. His army had grown strong and was well practiced. Camping in the high passes, Ladril saw the Black Hosts from afar and bade Durgin blow the call to arms on his mighty horn. Rogar's army poured down upon the enemy from two sides and battle was joined. Many foul creatures and good men perished that day. Yet, as the light of day faded, it was Darkness that fled the field. But the victory was not absolute. Zargon and his general escaped beyond the Sea of Claws, and even now they plot their revenge. Soon their plots will be ready and the Empire will have need of a new Rogar. But where are the Heroes to equal him?</p>
<p>You have much to learn if you are to become as great as Rogar and his companions. I will help all that I can. The book I protect—Loretome—was written when time began. All that ever was and all that ever will be is recorded in its countless pages. Through Loretome I may guide you, but I may not intervene, lest a greater evil befall the World, and the evil forces of Chaos triumph forever.</p>

<h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>
<p>Hero Quest is a fantasy adventure game set deep within a hidden stone labyrinth.  This maze of underground rooms and corridors is controlled by the Evil Sorcerer Zargon and his forces of Chaos.</p>
<p>Four valiant Heroes have been summoned by Mentor, the good and ancient sage, to do battle with Chaos. Theirs is the ultimate heroic challenge—descend into the treacherous world of the unknown and restore honor to the Empire. Destroy the evil forces of Chaos!</p>
<p>Bonded by their loyalty to the Empire, the brave Heroes unite. Stepping cautiously, they journey deeper and deeper into a dark, hidden world . . .</p>
<h1>What Makes Hero Quest Unique</h1>
<ul>
<li>One player assumes the role of Zargon, the Evil Sorcerer and controller of the game; the other players assume the roles of the Heroes—the Barbarian, the Dwarf, the Elf, and the Wizard.</li>
<li>A game for 2 to 5 players, Hero Quest is played in 14 sequential game playing sessions called Quests. Each Quest is described in detail in the Quest Book.</li>
<li>One Quest may take an hour or two to play, with each subsequent Quest increasing in difficulty.</li>
<li>During a Quest, a Hero may acquire valuable treasures. These riches may be used between Quests to purchase powerful weapons and protective armor from the Armory.</li>
<li>The Heroes work together to defeat Zargon and his forces of Chaos.  Individual winning is not the goal. United the Heroes stand. Divided they fall.</li>
<li>The adventure never ends. . .  Additional Quests, featuring all new challenges for the Heroes, are available in Quest Packs™ (sold separately).</li>

<h1>Assembly</h1>
<p>Before you play Hero Quest, several playing pieces must be assembled.  Detailed assembly instructions can be found on the inside of the game box lid.  For a look at the finished furniture, refer to the illustrations on the cardboard platform located inside the box.</p>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>Choose Your Role</h2>
<p>One player must assume the role of Zargon, the Evil Sorcerer. The other players must assume the roles of the Heroes: the Barbarian, the Dwarf, the Elf, and the Wizard.</p>
<p>If less than 5 people are playing, one person must still assume the role of Zargon. The remaining players are allowed to control more than one Hero.  Using less than 4 Heroes will make the Quests more difficult.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> The role of Zargon is a vital one. He serves as the Game Master; he sits behind the Information Screen; he controls the Quest for the other players; he alone knows where the monsters, secret doors, treasures, and traps are located in the labyrinth; he alone has access to the Quest Book.</p>
<p><b>Suggestion:</b> If you are the purchaser of this game and have gathered your friends together to play, you should play the role of Zargon.</p>
<h1>How Zargon Uses This Book</h1>
<p>As Zargon, you must first read this entire Instruction Booklet to yourself in order to understand how to run the Quest.</p>
<p>Once you are ready to begin play, read aloud to all of the players <em>A Glimpse Into The World of Hero Quest</em> on pages 10 & 11.</p>
<p>Remember, the <b>Quest Book</b> is for your eyes only. However, there <b>are</b> sections of each Quest that must be read aloud to the other players. These paragraphs are noted throughout the Quest Book.</p>
<p>To further simplify this Instruction Booklet, the following symbols will tell you which sections pertain to the Heroes and which sections pertain to you as Zargon. Look for these symbols throughout the book for quick reference.</p>

<h1 class="zargon">Zargon—Setting Up The Game</h1>
<p>Zargon, to set up the game properly, you must do the following eleven steps:</p>
<h3>1. Open The Quest Book</h3>
<p>Turn to <em>Quest 1—The Trial</em>. This Quest must be played first. Read it silently to yourself.</p>
<p>Each Quest features 3 different sections: The Parchment Text, the Quest Map, and the Quest Notes.</p>
<h4>Parchment Text</h4>
<p>The Parchment Text outlines the Heroes' challenge as well as the reward they will receive if they are successful. <b>This section is always read aloud to the Hero players at the beginning of the game.</b></p>
<h4>Quest Map</h4>
<p>The Quest Map shows how the gameboard is to be laid out as the game progresses. The map is marked with symbols that show the starting positions of the monsters—hideous creatures under your control. These symbols are identical to those on each of the monster cards, and are identified on the Information Screen.  The maps also show you where to place pieces of furniture, stairs, doors, and blocked square tiles. In addition, there are symbols for traps, secret doors, and treasure chests. These symbols are shown in the Identification Guide on the cardboard platform.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> Do not place anything on the gameboard at this time. You will reveal the gameboard layout only when the Hero figures have moved to a position on the gameboard that requires you to reveal something.</p>
<h4>Quest Notes</h4>
<p>Read the Quest Notes thoroughly before the start of the Quest. They explain what happens in certain rooms and detail the unique situations the Hero players will have to contend with. Read the notes silently to yourself. <b>Important: You will later disclose the Quest Notes information to the Heroes as the Quest unfolds and the Heroes move into certain rooms and corridors.</b></p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p>Open the gameboard and lay it flat on a table. The words HERO QUEST must face you.</p>
<h3>3. Character Cards</h3>
<p>Spread the 4 Character Cards faceup on the playing table. The number of dice and starting points are charted on each card.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/charactercard.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>Character Card</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>Attack Dice</h4>
<p>They reflect the fighting power of the Hero's weapon. During the Quest, the Hero's attack strength will continually be changed by events (spells, combat, etc.).</p>
<h4>Defend Dice</h4>
<p>They reflect the ability of the Hero to dodge or absorb enemy hits. During the Quest, the Hero's defend strength will continually be changed by events (spells, combat, etc.).</p>
<h4>Body Points</h4>
<p>They reflect the Hero's physical strength.  The Barbarian is the strongest with 8 points; the Wizard the weakest with 4 points.</p>
<h4>Mind Points</h4>
<p>They reflect the Hero's wisdom, intelligence and resistance to magical influence. The Wizard has the greatest mental strength with 6 points; the Barbarian the least with 2 points.</p>
<h3>4.</h3>
<p>Tear off 4 Character Sheets from the pad (see below). Give each Hero player a sheet, a pencil, his Hero's Character Card and the matching red plastic Hero figure.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/charactersheet.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>Character Sheet</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>5.</h3>
<p>Direct the Hero players to fill in their Character Sheets with the starting Body and Mind Points of their characters. If they wish, they may name their character.</p>
<p>During the Quest, a Hero's Body and Mind Points will be affected by events.  Points can be gained or lost. Body Points must be charted on the Hero's Character Sheet. Any treasure found on the Quest must also be recorded here. Players must save their sheets and bring them to each game session.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/chartingbodypoints.jpg"></img>
</figure>
<h3>6.</h3>
<p>Place the Information Screen so that it is between you and the gameboard.</p>
<h3>7.</h3>
<p>Place the Quest Book on the table between you and the Information Screen.</p>
<h3>8.</h3>
<p>Separate all of the assembled doors, furniture, the monsters, and all of the cardboard tiles into 4 groups or piles.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> For a quick identification of the monsters, refer to the last page of the Quest Book.</p>
<h3>9.</h3>
<p>Study the Quest Map. Place on the gameboard only the things that go into the starting room (usually the room with the stairway). <b>Note: Do NOT put out any traps or secret doors. Do NOT reveal treasure at this time.</b></p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/startingroom.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>Starting room of Quest 1 with the stairway tile and closed door.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>10. Sort The Cards</h3>
<p>The cards are to be sorted into 8 piles: Treasure Cards, Artifact Cards, Monster Cards, Chaos Spell Cards, Air Spell Cards, Fire Spell Cards, Water Spell Cards, and Earth Spell Cards.</p>
<h4>Treasure Cards</h4>
<p>Shuffle these cards before each Quest.  Keep them facedown in a pile within easy reach of all players.</p>
<h4>Artifact Cards</h4>
<p>These cards are special, as you will discover in the Quest Notes. Keep these cards behind the Information Screen.</p>
<h4>Monster Cards</h4>
<p>Spread out the 8 Monster Cards and put them faceup near the gameboard so that the Hero players can easily refer to them.  All the information on these cards can also be found in the Monster Chart on the Information Screen.</p>
<p>Chaos Spell Cards</p>
<p>There are 12 Chaos Spells. These spells belong to Zargon and are very powerful, as you will discover in the Quest Notes. Keep these cards behind the Information Screen.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Some Chaos Spell Cards will only be used with the Quest Packs (sold separately).</p>
<h4>Hero Spell Cards</h4>
<p>There are four groups of Hero spells, each group representing one of the 4 natural elements—Air, Fire, Water, Earth. Each spell group contains 3 individual spells. The spell groups are divided between the Wizard and the Elf.</p>
<h4>Dividing The Spells</h4>
<p>Direct the Hero players to divide the Hero spells. The Wizard must first choose one of the four spell groups.  Next, the Elf must choose one spell group from the three that remain.  Finally, the two remaining spell groups become the possessions of the Wizard.  A spell and its effects are explained in detail on its corresponding spell card.</p>
<p><b>Suggestion:</b> If this is the players' first Quest, the Wizard should take the Fire spells, the Elf should take the Earth spells, and the remaining spells should go to the Wizard.</p>
<h3>11.</h3>
<p>Finally, put 3 white combat dice and the 2 red dice near the gameboard where the Hero players can easily reach them. Keep 3 white combat dice for yourself.</p>
<h1>A GLIMPSE INTO THE WORLD OF HERO QUEST</h1>
<p>Welcome, my friends, to the world of Hero Quest—a place unlike any other . . . To gain access, you must first become a part of it. One of you will play the role of Zargon, the Evil Sorcerer; the rest of you will play the roles of the brave Heroes. As Heroes, you will work together to save the Empire from Zargon's evil forces. Will your valiant efforts be enough? Time will tell all. Heroes, you will begin your journey with Quest 1—The Trial from the Quest Book. Your goal is to seek out and destroy Verag, a foul Gargoyle who hides in the catacombs. Your very survival depends on your ability to work well together, for no true Hero stands alone.</p>
<p>Listen carefully now to these words from Zargon ...</p>
<p>"Heroes, your goal has been made clear. I, however, have my own goal—to destroy you! You will begin this first Quest in the room with the stairway. I will show you its location by placing the stairway tile on the gameboard. On each of your turns, you will discuss with your comrades where to move and what to do. Beware! Your decisions will affect all players.</p>
<p>"You will move square by square along corridors and into rooms. The distance of your movement will be determined by a roll of two red dice. Fate, you see, is really nothing more than chance. Where you move is within your control. What you find along the way, however, is within mine, for I control the gameboard. Let caution be your guide. Danger, you will soon discover, lurks in every shadow.</p>
<p>"As you look down corridors and into rooms, I will reveal to you many things, including closed doors, pieces of furniture, hideous monsters, blocked squares, and dangerous traps that you have sprung. I will place these items on the gameboard for you to see. Their locations are known to me long before you, for they are shown to me on my Quest Map—a document never to be seen by your eyes! To discover that which I already know, you must move cautiously. Peril lies in each step you take.<p>
<p>"As you venture deeper and deeper into the underworld, you will be confronted by many foul monsters. These creatures will greatly test your strength and courage. Some of you will battle them using only your sword and armor. Your success or failure will be determined by a roll of the combat dice, for these special dice reflect your attack and defend strength. Others of you will have the mighty power of magic spells to assist you. You must cast your spells wisely!</p>
<p>"While you may use your turn to engage in combat or to cast a spell, you may instead choose to perform another action.  These include searching for treasure, secret doors, or traps. You may even try to disarm a discovered, yet unsprung, trap. You must choose your action carefully, for you may only perform one action on your turn.</p>
<p>"Once each of you has completed a turn, only then will I take my turn. Prepare yourselves! My forces strike in great number. I control every monster present on the gameboard and may move all of them on one turn! Heed this warning. I am also armed with the power of magic. Dare you test your magical strength against mine?</p>
<p>"Your journey awaits. Prepare to meet the unknown! Will you survive the battles against my monster forces, or will your body and mind be forever weakened? Will you suffer the damage of hidden traps, or will you be able to locate and disarm them? Will you be trapped by walls of stone, or will you discover secret doorways? Will you find fortune through hidden treasures, or will greed and carelessness be your downfall? We shall see where fate takes you.</p>
<p>"Come. Let the Quest begin. . ."</p>
<h1 class="zargon">To Begin The Quest</h1>
<p>Zargon, read the Parchment Text section of Quest 1 from the Quest Book aloud to the Heroes. It is important that the Heroes understand the history behind the Quest and the goal set before them.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> Only read aloud the Parchment Text section. The information contained in the Quest Map and the Quest Notes must, for now, be kept secret from the Heroes.</p>
<h2>Order Of Play</h2>
<p>Play begins with the Hero seated to Zargon's left and continues clockwise.  After all Heroes have completed their turns, it is Zargon's turn. On his turn, Zargon may move all monsters currently on the gameboard. This sequence continues until the Quest is achieved or until the Heroes leave the underworld.</p>
<p><b>Hint:</b> A good starting setup would be for the Barbarian to sit to Zargon's left, followed by the Dwarf, the Elf, and then, seated to Zargon's right, the Wizard.</p>
<h2>On Any Player's Turn</h2>
<p>Whether playing the role of Zargon or that of a Hero, a player does one of the following on his turn:</p>
<ul><li>Moves his figure(s) and performs an action,</li></ul>
OR
<ul><li>Performs an action and moves his figure(s)</li></ul>
<h1 class="heroes">On A Hero's Turn</h1>
<p>As a Hero, you may move and then perform an action, OR you may perform an action and then move. You may not, however, move part way, perform an action, and then finish your movement. You may perform any one of the following six actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>ATTACK</li>
<li>CAST A SPELL (Wizard and Elf only)</li>
<li>SEARCH FOR TREASURE</li>
<li>SEARCH FOR SECRET DOORS</li>
<li>SEARCH FOR TRAPS</li>
<li>DISARM A TRAP</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions are also listed on the back of each Character Card for easy reference, and are explained in detail on pages 13-21.</p>
<h2>Hero Movement</h2>
<p>As a Hero, you normally begin and end a Quest in the room marked with the stairway (unless otherwise specified in the Quest Book). The stairway leads you down, down, down. . . deep into the evil stronghold of Chaos. To safely complete a Quest, you must return to the stairway, for it is only there that you are truly free from harm.</p>
<p>To determine how many square spaces to move, you must roll 2 red dice. Then, move carefully along the corridors and into rooms square by square. On the gameboard, the corridors are shown by the areas with light gray flooring. Corridors may be one or two squares wide.  The rooms are enclosed by white lines (the walls). <b>You do NOT have to move the entire distance indicated by the dice roll.</b> When moving, however, you cannot pass over monsters, move through walls or move diagonally. You MAY pass over other Heroes. You may only enter rooms through doors. You may not share a square with another Hero or with a monster. <b>Exceptions: When on the stairs or in pit traps, sharing a square is permitted.</b></p>

<h3>Looking And Opening Doors</h3>
<p>As a Hero, while moving, you may "look" down a corridor or through an open door. Looking gives you the opportunity to see what is directly within your line of sight, such as closed doors, blocked square spaces, and monsters. Looking is NOT one of the 6 actions. On your turn, you may move adjacent to a closed door and ask Zargon to open it. Zargon will open the door by removing the closed door piece and replacing it with an open door piece. Opening a door is also NOT one of the 6 actions. Both "looking" and "opening doors" are simply considered to be additional things you may do on your turn.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> All doors start out closed. Once a door is opened, it can never be closed.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> Getting caught in a trap, drinking potions, and picking things up also do not count as actions. They can be done at any time during your turn.</p>
<h2 class="zargon">How Zargon Reacts To Hero Movement</h2>
<p>As Zargon, you must carefully watch a Hero's movement. Continually refer to the Quest Map in the Quest Book.  When a Hero "looks" down a corridor, place on the gameboard any closed doors, blocked square tiles, and monsters that are directly within the Hero's line of sight. (See page 15 "SEE" for clear line of sight.) When a Hero opens a door, place on the gameboard the monsters, treasure chests, and any other items that belong in that room. <b>Note: Do not put out any traps or secret doors. Do not reveal treasure at this time.</b></p>
<h4>Blocked Square Tiles</h4>
<p>As Zargon, you must place a blocked square tile on the gameboard as soon as it becomes visible to the Hero. These tiles show where extra walls have been built. <b>Neither Heroes nor monsters can move through blocked squares.</b></p>
<h2 class="heroes">The 6 Hero Actions:</h2>
<p>As a Hero, you may do any one of the
following 6 actions on your turn. (It is possible, however, that you may not be able to do any.)</p>
<h2 class="heroes">Action 1—Attack</h2>
<p>As a Hero, you may attack any monster that you are adjacent to. You are adjacent if you are directly to the side, front, or rear of another square. You may, however, only attack once per turn. Your attack strength depends on your attack weapon. The stronger the weapon, the greater the number of Attack Dice used. Some weapons allow you to attack diagonally or from a distance. Most weapons, however, do not.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/adjacent.jpg"></img>
<figcaption style="font-weight: bold">
The Elf is considered adjacent to the monster in any of these four positions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><b>Important:</b> You may only attack with one weapon at a time.</p>
<p>At the start of the first Quest, each Hero is armed with a specific weapon.  Refer to the Hero's Character Card for his Starting Weapon and Attack Dice number.</p>
<p><b>The Barbarian</b> begins with the greatest starting weapon, the broadsword.</p>
<p><b>The Dwarf's</b> starting weapon is a shortsword. He also possesses an inner strength—a special knack for disarming traps.</p>
<p><b>The Elf</b> also starts with a shortsword.  He is a good fighter and has some knowledge of the magical arts. The Elf begins each Quest with 3 magic spells (one spell group).</p>
<p><b>The Wizard</b> starts with a small dagger.  He has great knowledge of magic and is a master spellcaster. He begins each Quest with 9 magic spells (three spell groups). However, he is handicapped by his inability to wear normal armor or use large weapons.</p>
<h3>How A Hero Attacks</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a Hero, you must roll the white combat dice to attack. The number of dice to roll depends on the weapon you are using for the attack. (Check your Character Sheet for your attack strength.) Failure to roll any skulls results in a failed attack.</li>
<li>Each skull rolled is considered a hit, resulting in 1 Body Point of damage scored against the monster. If hit, the monster immediately defends by rolling its Defend Dice. If the monster's Body Points reach zero, the monster is considered dead and is removed from the gameboard.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/skull.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>Skull rolled.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 class="zargon">How A Monster Defends</h3>
<ul>
<li>A defending monster rolls the number of Defend Dice shown in the Monster Chart on the Information Screen. Each black shield rolled by the defending monster blocks 1 hit from the attacking Hero.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/blackshield.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>Black Shield rolled.</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Many monsters are killed with only 1 hit. Some monsters, however, require more than 1 hit. (Refer to the Monster Chart on the Information Screen for a monster's Body Points.) For those monsters requiring more than 1 hit, monster damage is tracked by the use of skull tiles. Zargon, for each hit your monster sustains, you must record the hit by placing a skull tile under the monster figure on the gameboard.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/skulltile.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>Skull Tile</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><b>Note:</b> If the monster survives the attack, it cannot attack the Hero back until Zargon's next turn. (See <em>How A Monster Attacks</em> and <em>How A Hero Defends</em> on page 22.)</p>
<h3 class="heroes">A Trip To The Armory</h3>
<p>As a Hero, you may collect valuable treasures, such as gold coins, during a Quest. Between Quests, you may use gold coins to purchase powerful weapons and protective armor from the Armory. (See cardboard platform.)</p>
<p>These weapons allow you to increase your attack and defend strength, and may also give you unique combat advantages.</p>
<p>For instance, daggers and crossbows are special weapons due to their ability to hit a monster from a distance.</p>
<p>Some long weapons, like the staff and the longsword, allow you to attack diagonally. The attack is made and defended normally.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/diagonal.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>The Wizard, with a staff, is in a "safe" position. The staff allows him to attack the monster diagonally. The monster, however, cannot attack the Wizard diagonally.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using diagonal weapons allows more than one Hero to attack a monster blocking a doorway.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/diagonal2.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>Both the Wizard and the Barbarian may attack the monster blocking the doorway.  The Wizard, with a staff, may attack diagonally. The Barbarian, with a broadsword, may attack adjacently.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><b>Note:</b> For complete information on all of the weapons and armor, please refer to the Armory on the cardboard platform.</p>
<h2 class="heroes">Action 2—Cast A Spell (Elf and Wizard Only)</h2>
<p>As the Elf or the Wizard, you may cast a spell instead of attacking. You may cast a spell at anything you can "see." <b>Important: You may only cast a spell on your turn.</b></p>
<h3>"SEE"</h3>
<p>For the Elf or Wizard to cast a spell, the target must be visible. Heroes and monsters are only visible if an unobstructed straight line can be traced from the spellcaster to the target.</p>
<p><b>A Good Rule of Thumb:</b> Draw an invisible straight line between the center of the square the spellcaster is on and the center of the square the target is on.  If the line does not cross a wall, closed door, Hero or monster, the target is declared visible, even if the line just touches a corner or wall edge. The following diagram shows an example of what is visible.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/los.jpg"></img>
</figure>
<p>As the Elf or the Wizard, you may cast a spell on yourself, another Hero, or on a monster. Once a spell is cast, the spell card is discarded for the remainder of the Quest. Each spell may be cast only once per Quest. Use them wisely!</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> A spell and its effects are explained in detail on its corresponding spell card.</p>
<h2 class="heroes">Action 3—Search For Treasure</h2>
<p>Treasure is found only in rooms, not in corridors. A room may be searched by all 4 Heroes, but each individual Hero may only search the room once, and may do so only on his own turn.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Some treasures are protected by a trap. See <em>Search For Traps</em> on page 17.</p>
<h3>How A Hero Searches For Treasure</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a Hero, you may search a room for treasure only if the room is uninhabited by monsters.</li>
<li>As a Hero, you must first verbally declare your search. Do so by saying, "I am searching for treasure." Searching for treasure means you are looking around, opening things, searching for interesting objects and gold coins, regardless of what square you are on in the room. <b>Do not move your Hero figure when you search.</b></li>
<li>If there is no special treasure called out to Zargon in the Quest Book, you, as a Hero, must draw a random card from the Treasure Card deck and read it aloud. The card could offer you a variety of things, including riches and magical potions. Record any gold coins or potions on your Character Sheet.  These "valuable" Treasure Cards (gold coins and potions) are NOT returned to the treasure deck until the next Quest.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you wish, you may share the gold coin treasures with the other Heroes.  Later, between Quests, you may use the treasure to purchase additional weapons and armor from the Armory. (See A <em>Trip To The Armory</em> on page 14.)</p>
<p><b>Be careful! Almost half of the Treasure Cards contain Wandering Monsters and Hazards! These "bad" Treasure Cards ARE returned to the treasure deck and may be re-drawn in the next treasure search. IMPORTANT! The Treasure Cards must be shuffled before a Hero draws one from the deck.</b><p>
<h2 class="zargon">How Zargon Reacts To A Hero's Search For Treasure</h2>
<p>As Zargon, if there is a special treasure (as described in the Quest Notes), you must read aloud the treasure description once the treasure has been found. The special treasure is discovered only once by the first Hero who searches the room for treasure, even if other Heroes later search that same room.</p>
<p>If there is no special treasure in the searched room, direct the searching Hero to draw a Treasure Card as described. However, if the Hero draws a Wandering Monster or Hazard card, do the following:</p>
<h3 class="zargon">Wandering Monsters</h3>
<p>These monsters pop out of holes and hidden places, and wander into rooms.  (The monster that appears is listed in the Quest Notes.)</p>
<p>As Zargon, you must place the monster next to the treasure-searcher and immediately roll Attack Dice. (Refer to the Monster Chart on the Information Screen for the correct number of Attack Dice to use.) On this round, you can only attack the treasure-searcher. After the attack, the Wandering Monster remains on the gameboard and can be moved like other monsters.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If the surrounding squares are occupied, and it is not possible to place a monster next to the searcher, put the monster in the room as close to the searcher as possible. Then, on your next turn, the monster can move and attack like other monsters.</p>
<h2 class="heroes">How Heroes Respond To Wandering Monsters</h2>
<ul><li>As a Hero, you roll combat dice to defend against a Wandering Monster's attack. You may then continue with your turn. (See <em>How A Hero Defends</em> on page 22.)</li></ul>
<h3 class="heroes">Hazards!</h3>
<p>As a Hero, when you draw a Hazard Card from the Treasure Card deck, read the card aloud and follow its directions.</p>
<h2 class="heroes">More About Treasures</h2>
<p>Treasure can be a variety of things, including gold coins, magic spells, artifacts, and potions.</p>
<h3>Artifacts</h3>
<p>Ten of the special treasures are called 'artifacts.' Each is described in detail on its corresponding Artifact Card.  These items include weapons, armor and items that provide additional powers. Finding an artifact may also be the objective of a particular Quest.  <b>Important! Certain artifacts may only be used by a specific Hero.</b> For example, the Wizard's Cloak and the Wizard's Staff may only be used by the Wizard. If another Hero finds one of these items, he should give it to the Wizard.</p>
<h3>Potions</h3>
<p>As a Hero, you may drink a potion at any time. The way a potion works and how long its effects last are listed on the potion Treasure Card, and sometimes in the Quest Book. You may drink more than one potion at any time. Healing potions are very valuable. If your Body Points are reduced to zero, you may drink a healing potion before you die and save yourself by restoring 1 or more of your Body Points. You may give one of your potions to a fellow Hero, but you may do so only on <em>your</em> turn.</p>
<h2 class="heroes">Action 4—Search for Secret Doors</h2>
<p>Secret doors are hidden portals that cannot be seen when you, as a Hero, "look" into a room or down a corridor.  These doors are concealed in a variety of ways, including sliding panels and pivoting bricks. <b>You will not discover a secret door unless you search for one.</b></p>
<h3>How A Hero Searches For Secret Doors</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a Hero, you can only search for secret doors if there are no monsters visible to you.</li>
<li>You must first verbally declare your search. Do so by saying, "I am searching for secret doors." Zargon will then disclose any secret doors located in the room or corridor that you are in by placing a secret door tile on the gameboard square where the secret door is located. <b>Do not move your Hero figure when you search.</b></li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/secretdoor.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>Secret Door Tile</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>The door is not considered OPEN until you move adjacent to it and declare that you are opening it. Once the door is opened, Zargon will place on the gameboard the items that are beyond the secret doorway. Once opened, the door cannot be closed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heroes">Action 5—Search For Traps</h2>
<p>There are four kinds of traps—pit traps, falling block traps, spear traps, and chest/furniture traps. They can be found in both rooms and corridors. Only Zargon knows where these traps are hidden. If, as a Hero, you move onto a square that contains a pit, falling block or spear trap, you will automatically spring the trap, possibly suffering body damage.</p>
<p>A treasure chest or piece of furniture may also contain a trap. If you search for treasure without first searching for traps, you will spring the trap. Remember, it often pays to take the time to search.</p>
<h3>How A Hero Searches For Traps</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a Hero, you can only search for traps if there are no monsters visible to you.</li>
<li>You must first verbally declare your search. Do so by saying, "I am searching for traps." Zargon will then tell you which squares, if any, have traps. He will NOT, however, put any trap tiles out on the board. At this time, they are still concealed and unsprung.</li>
<li>Once a trap is discovered, you may be able to JUMP the trap, or on your next turn, DISARM it. (See <em>Action 6— Disarm A Trap</em> on page 21.)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Warning:</b> There are some traps in a room that have been placed directly on the other side of a door. Beware! The first Hero to enter the room through that door will encounter the trap and suffer damage! <b>Note: As a Hero, you cannot search for these traps by looking through the door. You must be in the room to search for any traps in it.</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Monsters do not spring hidden traps.</p>
<h3>The 4 Kinds Of Traps</h3>
<p>The locations of pit traps, falling block traps, spear traps, and chest/furniture traps are marked in gold on the Quest Maps in the Quest Book.</p>
<h4>Pit Traps</h4>
<p>A pit trap is a covered hole in the floor.  If the trap is found during a search, Zargon will say that the floor looks weak and will point to the square where the trap is located. Zargon will NOT put a pit trap tile on the gameboard at this time. It has not yet been sprung. Once a pit trap is discovered, a Hero may be able to JUMP the trap, or on his next turn, DISARM it. (See <em>Jumping A Trap</em> on page 20, and <em>Disarm a Trap</em> on page 21.) If a Hero does not search for traps and moves onto a pit trap square, he automatically springs the trap.</p>
<h4>Springing A Pit Trap</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a Hero, if you move onto a pit trap square, Zargon will stop you by saying, "You have just stumbled into a pit!"</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/springpittrap.jpg"></img>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Zargon will then put a pit trap tile on that square (under your Hero figure) and will tell you that you suffered 1 Body Point of damage in the fall. This ends your turn. You must then record your Body Point damage on your Character Sheet.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/chartingbodypoints2.jpg"></img>
</figure>
<h4>What Happens To A Hero In A Pit?</h4>
<ul>
<li> As a Hero, once in a pit, you may search the pit for treasure or secret doors as if it were a separate room unto itself.</li>
<li>When in a pit, you may also attack and defend, but you must roll one less combat die when doing so. (<em>This applies to monsters as well.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> As a Hero, your minimum attack or defend strength is always 1 combat die, even if the pit penalty would reduce your dice to zero.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, you can move out of a pit on your next turn.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Once a pit trap is <em>sprung</em> and a pit tile placed on the board, the trap cannot be disarmed and removed. As a Hero, you may, however, attempt to JUMP over it. (See <em>Jumping A Trap</em> on page 20.)</p>
<h4>Falling Block Traps</h4>
<p>Heroes beware! Falling block traps are very dangerous. Stepping on one may trigger the ceiling to collapse. If such a trap is found during a search, Zargon will say that the ceiling looks dangerous and will point to the square where the trap is located. Zargon will NOT put a falling block trap tile on the gameboard at this time. It has not yet been sprung.  Once an unsprung falling block trap is discovered, a Hero may attempt to JUMP the trap, or may later try to DISARM it on his next turn. If a Hero does not search for traps and moves onto a falling block trap square, he springs the trap.</p>
<h4>Springing A Falling Block Trap</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a Hero, if you move onto a falling block trap square, Zargon will stop you by saying, "You've just sprung a falling block trap! The ceiling is caving in! Look out!"</li>
<li>Zargon will then put a falling block trap tile on the square, under your Hero figure.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Once a falling block trap has been sprung and put out on the board, it cannot be disarmed or jumped.</p> <ul>
<li>Zargon will then give you 3 combat dice to roll. For each skull rolled, you suffer 1 Body Point of damage. <em>You may NOT roll Defend Dice.</em></li>
<li>You must now make a decision. You can either move ahead or move back to an empty space. Remember, the trap space is now a <em>permanent</em> block in the game. Your decision is a critical one.  You could become trapped forever, or you could be cut off from the rest of the Heroes.</li>
<li>Move to the space you have decided upon. This ends your turn.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Spear Traps</h4>
<p>A spear trap is carefully hidden. If found during a search, Zargon will say that the square looks suspicious and will point to the square where the trap is located. Once a spear trap is discovered, a Hero may attempt to JUMP the trap or DISARM it. As a Hero, when you step onto a spear trap square, you automatically spring the trap. This causes a spear to thrust out of the wall, floor, or ceiling.</p>
<h4>Springing A Spear Trap</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a Hero, when moving onto a spear trap square, you must roll one combat die. If you roll a skull, you suffer 1 Body Point of damage. This ends your turn. If you roll <em>either</em> a black or white shield, you have dodged out of the way of the spear. You may then continue with your move. The spear trap is now gone forever and the square can be moved onto safely.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> There are no spear trap tiles.</p>
<h4>Chest/Furniture Traps</h4>
<p>A chest/furniture trap can be a variety of things, including poisonous gas, poison needle, explosive latch, or a shooting dart.</p>
<p>If the room or corridor that the chest/furniture is located in is being searched for traps, Zargon will say that the chest/furniture looks dangerous and will point to the chest/furniture in question. Once a chest/furniture trap is discovered, a Hero may attempt to DISARM it on his next turn.</p>
<h4>Springing A Chest/Furniture Trap</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a Hero, if you search a room for treasure, before searching the room for traps, any chest/furniture traps in the room will be sprung, ending your turn.  You then suffer the consequences described to Zargon in the Quest Notes.</li>
<li>If you successfully disarm the trap, the trap is removed and you may continue with your move. (See <em>Disarm A Trap</em> on page 21.) You may search the disarmed chest/furniture for treasure on your next turn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jumping A Trap</h3>
<p>As a Hero, if your path is blocked by a trap, you may attempt to pass by jumping over it. To jump over a trap, you must do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least two squares of movement remaining, as if you moved onto the trap square and then onto one unoccupied ADJACENT square beyond.</li>
<li>You must roll anything but a skull on 1 combat die to jump the trap. If a skull is rolled, you spring the trap, suffering the body damage caused by that particular type of trap. If there is a corresponding trap tile, it will then be put on the gameboard by Zargon. You are then put on the trap square. This ends your turn.</li>
<li>If you avoid rolling a skull, you can jump over the trap, expending two moves. If you have any moves remaining from your dice roll, you may then continue your move.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Once a falling block trap has been sprung, it CANNOT be jumped. The path is permanently blocked by a wall of fallen stone. However, once a pit trap has been sprung, the hole in the ground, though dangerous, CAN be jumped.</p>
<h4>More About Jumping Pit Traps:</h4>
<p>There may be as many as 3 possible squares to jump to on the other sides of a single pit. However, a pit in the corner of a corridor has only 1 space open to jump across to.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/jump.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>To successfully jump this corner pit trap, a Hero must jump across to square X.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the above illustration, if the X square is occupied by a monster, and you are a Hero without any special armory weapons, you must voluntarily fall into the pit (suffering damage) and do combat with the monster (at a disadvantage) from in the pit!</p>
<p>Monsters, with enough Movement Squares (and a vacant space beyond), will always successfully jump over a pit.  If they voluntarily enter a pit, they will suffer no damage.</p>
<h2 class="heroes">Action 6—Disarm A Trap</h2>
<p>As a Hero, to disarm an unsprung trap, you must first know its location, and you must possess a tool kit (or be the Dwarf). A tool kit may be purchased between Quests at the Armory. (See cardboard platform.)</p>
<h3>How A Hero* Disarms A Trap With A Tool Kit</h3>
<p><b>(*Does not apply to the Dwarf)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>As a Hero, <em>before</em> you move, you must announce that you are moving onto the trap square to attempt to disarm and remove the trap.</li>
<li>You must move onto the trap square and roll 1 combat die. If you roll a skull, you have sprung the trap, suffering body damage. If you <em>roll</em> either a black or white shield, the trap is disarmed.  A disarmed trap is considered "gone" and is not put out on the gameboard.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How The Dwarf Disarms A Trap</h3>
<p>As the Dwarf, you <em>never</em> need a tool kit to disarm a trap! Your odds of succeeding are great due to your innate skills. To disarm a trap, you must do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you move, you must announce that you are moving onto the trap square to attempt to disarm and remove the trap.</li>
<li>Roll 1 combat die. If you roll a black shield, you have sprung the trap, suffering body damage. If you roll anything except a black shield, the trap is disarmed.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> A disarmed pit trap is considered to be a regular gameboard square.</p>
<h1 class="zargon">Zargon, The Evil Sorcerer's Turn</h1>
<p>Zargon, only after ALL 4 Heroes have completed a turn is it your turn. You may then move every monster currently on the gameboard. Like Heroes, monsters may move and perform an action, OR may perform an action and then move. A monster cannot move part way, perform an action, and then finish its movement.</p>
<p>Each monster may perform one of the following two actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>ATTACK</li>
<li>CAST A CHAOS SPELL</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Only certain monsters may cast a spell. Refer to the Quest Notes in the Quest Book for more information.</p>
<p><b>Monsters May Not:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Search for treasure</li>
<li>Search for secret doors</li>
<li>Move or attack diagonally</li>
<li>Pass over Heroes</li>
<li>Move through walls</li>
<li>Open or close doors</li>
<li>Share a square on the gameboard</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> Monsters do not spring hidden traps. Therefore, they have no need to search for them, or to disarm them.</p>
<h3>Monster Movement</h3>
<p>Unlike Heroes, monsters do not move by dice roll. Each monster's maximum movement per turn is listed in the Monster Chart on the Information Screen, and also on the 8 Monster Cards. <b>Monsters do not have to move the entire distance indicated on the Monster Chart.</b></p>
<h2 class="zargon">The 2 Monster Actions:</h2>
<h3>Action 1—Attack</h3>
<p>A monster may attack any Hero that it is adjacent to. However, a monster may only attack once per turn. A monster's attack strength is based on its natural abilities and does not depend on a weapon.</p>
<h4>How A Monster Attacks</h4>
<ul>
<li>An attacking monster rolls the number of Attack Dice shown in the Monster Chart on the Information Screen. Failure to roll any skulls results in a failed attack.</li>
<li>Each skull rolled is considered a hit, resulting in 1 Body Point of damage scored against the Hero. <em>If hit, the Hero immediately defends by rolling its Defend Dice.</em> If the Hero's Body Points reach zero, the Hero is considered dead.  (See <em>Dead Heroes</em>.) <b>Important! If the Hero has 1 Body Point remaining, and takes more than | hit of damage, his Body Points are still only reduced to zero.</b></li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/skull.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>Skull rolled.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 class="heroes">How A Hero Defends</h4>
<p>A defending Hero usually rolls 2 Defend Dice (<em>less</em> if in a pit or under certain spells, and <em>more</em> after purchasing armor).  Each white shield rolled by the defending Hero blocks 1 hit from the attacking monster.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/Rules/whiteshield.jpg"></img>
<figcaption>White Shield rolled.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Action 2—Cast A Chaos Spell</h3>
<p>As Zargon, you may cast a Chaos Spell instead of attacking. You must give your Chaos Spells to specific monsters as called for in the Quest notes. A monster can only cast a spell on a Hero that it can "see." <b>Important: You may only cast a spell on your turn.</b> A spell may only be cast once per Quest. Once a spell is cast, the spell card is discarded for the remainder of the Quest. A spell and its effects are explained in detail on its corresponding spell card.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Several of the Chaos Spells are not used in the first 14 Quests. They will be used in future Quests and can also be used by you when designing your own Quests.</p>
<h3 class="heroes">Dead Heroes</h3>
<p>As a Hero, you die when your Body Points are reduced to zero, and you do not have a Healing Spell or Healing Potion to save yourself.</p>
<h4>What Happens To A Dead Hero?</h4>
<p>As a Hero, if you die, you are out of the game for the rest of that Quest. You may, however, rename your Hero and play him as a new character in the next Quest. Armor, weapons, and treasures that belonged to you prior to death can be picked up by any other Hero in the room with you.</p>
<p><b>Warning!</b> If there are no other Heroes in the room or corridor with you when you die, any monster in the room or corridor with you will claim your possessions. It may not, however, use them. They are removed from the game.</p>
<h4>How A Hero Escapes Death</h4>
<p>As a Hero, if your Body Points have been reduced to zero, there are two situations where you can save yourself:</p>
<p>1) If you have a Healing Potion in your possession, you can immediately drink it. The potion will instantly raise your Body Points above zero, restoring you to life.</p>
<p>2) If you are a spellcaster with a Healing Spell, and you have not already performed an action on your turn, you can be healed by casting the spell on yourself.</p>
<p><b>Important!</b> After your Body Points have reached zero, you can never be saved by a fellow Hero's spell or potion. It will be too late. You will have died by the time it is your fellow Hero's turn—the only time when he can cast a spell or give you a potion.</p>
<h2 class="zargon">What Happens If You Run Out Of Monsters?</h2>
<p>Some Quests may require more monsters than are available in the game. This could happen if the Heroes fail to kill monsters. Killed monsters may be used again later in the Quest if the Quest Book calls for their placement. However, if all the monsters of a particular type are already on the gameboard and you, as Zargon, need to place another one, you may use any monster that is of the same color as the one that should have been used.</p>
<h1>Ending The Quest</h1>
<p>As a Hero, you successfully complete a Quest only when you have achieved the Quest goal AND have returned to the safety of the stairway. A Quest may be ended early by the players voluntarily returning to the stairway before completing the Quest, or by all 4 Heroes dying in their attempt to complete the Quest.</p>
<p>There is usually a final treasure or a reward associated with successfully completing a Quest. Your valiant efforts are rewarded by splitting the reward amongst yourselves.</p>
<p>After successfully completing the Quest, circle the corresponding Quest number on your Character Sheet. Keep this sheet as a record of the Quests you have completed.</p>
<h1>What Happens Between Quests?</h1>
<p>As a Hero, your starting Body and Mind Points are automatically restored once you have successfully completed the Quest and have returned safely to the stairway. All spells are then returned to the Wizard and the Elf.</p>
<p>Finally, you may now visit the Armory and purchase new weapons and armor with the gold coins you have accumulated. Be patient. It may take a few Quests before you have enough money to purchase anything.</p>
<p><b>Wizard:</b> Since there are so few things that you can buy from the Armory, it would be wise for you to save your money.  Other powerful magic items will be offered for sale in future adventures (in the Quest Packs). You may wish to spend your money on those items.</p>
<p><b>Important!</b> You keep any treasures found and take them with you on your next Quest. Remember, Heroes, to subtract from your Character Sheet any gold coins spent. Save this sheet between Quests and use it again!</p>
<h2 class="zargon">Lost Artifacts</h2>
<p>It is sometimes required that the Heroes have a specific artifact in their possession before they continue on to the next Quest.  Zargon, if a Hero dies while in possession of an artifact, and your monsters steal the artifact, you must include the artifact as a special treasure early in the next Quest.</p>
<h2 class="zargon">Unfinished Quests</h2>
<p>Zargon, if a Quest ends with disastrous results (such as death for all 4 Heroes), or goes unfinished, you should modify the Quest before it is replayed. You can do this by creating a new adventure using the blank map and symbols at the end of the Quest Book.</p>
