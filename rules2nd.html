<h1>Hero Quest</h1>
<h2>RULES OF PLAY</h2>
<p>"Heed well the words of Mentor, Guardian of Loretome, and I will tell you of times past, of darker days when the Empire was saved against all hope. For I fear the darkness is about to return..."</p>
<p>"The fell legions of Morcar, Lord of Chaos, had swept all before them. At the sight of the Black Banner and the massed hordes of Chaos, even the bravest warriors of the Emperor had turned tail and fled, the land was laid waste and all men despaired.</p>
<p>"But then there came a mighty warrior Prince from the Borderlands - Rogar the Barbarian they called him. He bore a glittering diamond on his brow - the Star of the West - as worn by the ancient kings of legend. Hope returned and men flocked to his standard, leaving their hiding places in the hills and forests. Other great heroes joined him: Durgin, the fearless Dwarven warrior from the "World's Erge Mountains.
Ladril the Elven fighter mage from distant Athelorn and Telor the Wizard whose sorcery was to save Rogar on many occasions.</p>
<p>"For many years Rogar trained his army, being careful to avoid open battle with Morcar's general until all was ready, but ever harried their supply lines, wiping out countless Ores and Goblins. </p>
<p> "Then came the day for which Rogar had waited. His army had grown strong and was well practised. Camping in the high passes, Ladril saw the Black Hosts from afar and bade “Durgin blow the call to arms on his mighty horn. Rogar's army poured down upon the enemy from two sides and battle was joined. Many foul creature and good men perished that day. Yet, as the light of day faded it was Darkness that fled the field. ut the vietory was not absolute. Morcar and his general escaped beyond the Sea of Claws, and even now they plot their revenge. Soon their plots will be ready and the Empire will have need of a new Rogar. “But where are the heroes to equal him? You have much to learn if you are to become as great as Rogar and his companions. I will help all I can. The book I carry - Loretome - was written when time began. All that ever was and all that ever will be is recorded in its countless pages. Through Loretome I may guide you, but I may not intervene, lest a greater evil befall the World, and Chaos triumph forever."</p>

<h4>Assembly</h4>
<p>Before you can begin to play Hero Quest there are several playing pieces that need to be assembled.
You will find detailed assembly instructions inside the lid of the box.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hero Quest is a game of adventure, set in a land besieged by the forces of Chaos. Mentor, the mysterious and ancient wizard-sage has summoned four valiant adventurers to undertake the challenge of becoming Heroes and saving the land.</p>
<h1>About these rules</h1>
<p>The rules are split into two stages: the Introductory game and the Full game. The introductory game is designed to let you to play a game without having to cope with <b>all</b> the rules. Once you have played your first Quest you will be ready to learn the rest of the rules and play the other Quests.</p>
<h1>Outline of the Game</h1>
<p>There can be up to five players in the game. One player must act as Morcar, the evil wizard, and control his force of monsters. This player is called the <b>evil wizard player</b>. The other players control the four would-be heroes: the Elf, Dwarf, Wizard and Barbarian. These players are called <b>character players</b>.</p>
<p>Each game presents a new challenge to the character players. First the evil wizard player chooses one of the Quests from the Quest Book and reads out the text in the parchment panel. This will tell the character players what they are to do. The evil wizard player then looks at the Quest map and sets up the first room. This is the room that contains the stairway tile. <b>Only</b> this room is placed onto the board at the start of the game. The other rooms and passages are placed out as the heroes move around the board.</p>
<p>Play begins with the player to the left of the evil wizard player and then proceeds clockwise.
During a character player’s turn he may <b>move</b> and perform one other action, which can be one of the following four:
</p>
<p>i. Attack another character or monster</p>
<p>ii. Cast a spell</p>
<p>iii. Search for secret doors and traps <b>or</b></p>
<p>iv. Search for treasure.</p>
<p>The player may choose to move before <em>or</em> after he has done one of the above. (In the Introductory game character players will only be able to move and attack.)</p>
<p>As the character players move they will discover more of the board. The evil wizard player will place onto the board anything that the character players can see. Therefore, when a character player opens a closed door he must pause to give the evil wizard player the chance to consult the Quest map and place onto the board anything that is shown for that room.</p>
<p>During the evil wizard player’s turn he may move and attack with each of the monsters he has on the board. Each monster may move and then attack or attack and then move in the same way the character players may move and attack.</p>
<p>The game continues until either all of the character players have been defeated or all the surviving heroes have returned to the stairway tile and escaped.</p>
<h1>Choosing Roles</h1>
<p>Roll one die each to decide who should choose their role first. One player <b>must</b> take the role of the evil wizard player. The last player to choose a role must play the part of the evil wizard player if no-one has already chosen to do so.</p>
<p>If there are fewer than five players, you may decide to take more than one character each, or use fewer than the four characters. This will make the game harder for the character players, although the rewards will be split between fewer characters.</p>
<h1>Setting up the Game</h1>
<p>Each of the character players should take the following:</p>
<dd><p>The appropriate plastic miniature and matching character board, plus a character sheet from the pad.</p></dd>
<p>The evil wizard player takes:</p>
<dd><p>The screen, the Quest Book and the playing Cards; he should also have all the monster figures and furniture pieces close to hand.</p></dd>
<p>The evil wizard player sits behind the screen, and arranges the board so that the words <b>Hero Quest</b> face him.</p>
<p>He sorts the cards into their various categories: treasure, monster, equipment, spells and Quest treasures. The shuffled treasure cards should be placed, face- down, within reach of the player characters. The monster cards should be kept, face-up, behind the screen.<y/p>
<p>The Quest Book and the other playing cards will be explained later, put them to one side.</p>
<p>Finally, the character players fill in their character sheets according to the details on their character boards.</p>
<h1>Character Boards and Sheets</h1>
<p>The character boards tell the character players how many dice to roll. The character sheets are used to record each character player’s progress during the game. Each board has a picture of the character, plus the following details:</p>
<h2>Character Type:</h2>
<p>Copy this into the box provided on the character sheet. This will be "Wizard", "Barbarian", "Elf" or "Dwarf".</p>
<h2>Body:</h2>
<p>This is a measure of your character's physical strength. Enter the value for Body onto your character sheet. During the game you may gain or lose Body points. Keep track of your current score on your character sheet. If the total ever reaches zero, your character is eliminated. Lost Body points may be healed by magic (spells and potions). However, this magic will never take the total above the starting level, it will only restore <em>lost</em> Body points.</p>
<h2>Mind:</h2>
<p>This is a measure of your character's wisdom. Enter the number shown into the Mind box on your character sheet. During the game you may gain or lose Mind points. Keep track of your current score on your character sheet. If the total ever reaches zero, your character is eliminated. <em>Mind points are not used in the initial Quests. They will become more important in future expansions to Hero Quest.</em></p>
<p>Now you must think of a name for your character and write it in the box provided on your sheet. For example, the Elf might be called Ladril, the Dwarf could be Grungi, the Wizard might be Zoltan, the Barbarian Sigmar, and so on. Use whichever name you feel is appropriate.</p>
<p>Finally a blank shield is provided on each character sheet where you can design your own coat-of-arms and motto.</p>
<h1>The Quest Book</h1>
<p>The Quest book is used by the evil wizard player and contains a number of Quests. There are three main parts to each Quest:</p>
<h3>(i) Parchment text</h3>
<p>The parchment text outlines the heroes’ challenge as well as the reward they will receive if they are successful. This is read aloud by the evil wizard player at the earching beginning of the game.</p>
<h3>(ii) Quest Map</h3>
<p>The Quest map shows how the board is to be laid out. The symbols used on the maps for furniture are identified on the inside of the screen. The symbols for the monsters are identified on the monster cards.</p>
<p>Only the room with the stairway tile is placed onto the board at the start of the game.  As the character players move around the board the evil wizard player must consult the Quest map to see what should be placed into each room or passageway.</p>
<h3>(iii) Notes</h3>
<p>Finally there are a number of notes for each Quest. The evil wizard player should quickly glance through these at the start of each Quest. The notes will explain what happens in certain rooms and provide unique situations for the character players to deal with.</p>
<h2>Monster cards</h2>
<p>These cards are used by the evil wizard player. There is one card for each type of monster. They show how many dice to roll during the game.</p>
<h2>The Screen</h2>
<p>The maps in the Quest book use the symbols shown on the inside of the screen to represent the various pieces of furniture, monsters and traps. The inside of the screen also contains the rules for the different types of trap. Traps are not used in the Basic game. They are dealt with in the Full game rules.</p>
<h1>Introductory Game</h1>
<p>The Introductory game allows you to play your first adventure. The Introductory game does not use any of the playing cards other than the Monster cards. Read the rules through carefully before you begin to play.</p>
<h2>Preparing for play</h2>
<p>The stairway is the entrance into and out of the stronghold. The character players place their miniatures on any square next to the stairway tile. The contents of this room should be laid out at the beginning of the game. All doors should be closed. No other pieces outside this room should be placed on the board. These should only be set up when they become visible to the characters.</p>
<h1>Order of play</h1>
<p>Each player moves in turn, starting with the player to the left of the evil wizard player and continuing clockwise.</p>
<p>When it is your turn, you may both <em>move</em> and <em>fight</em>. You may move <em>first, then</em> fight, or you may fight <em>first, then</em> move. You may <em>not</em> take part of your move, fight, then finish your move.</p>
<p>On his turn, the evil wizard player may move <em>some</em> or <em>all</em> of his monsters currently on the board. He moves each monster in turn. Monsters may <em>first</em> move <em>then</em> fight, or fight <em>first</em> and <em>then</em> move as do the player characters.</p>
<h2>Movement</h2>
<p>The squares on the board are divided into two types of area: rooms and passages. The rooms are enclosed by white lines (the walls). The passages are shown by the areas with light grey flooring. Passages may be one or two squares wide.</p>
<p>The character boards show how many dice to roll to determine how many squares can be moved. Character players <em>do not</em> have to move the full distance indicated by the total of the dice.</p>
<p>The monster cards simply show the maximum number of squares that may be moved by each monster of that type. Therefore, the dice need not be rolled when moving monsters.</p>
<p>When moving, characters and monsters may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>move diagonally;</li>
<li>move onto an occupied square. Characters and monsters may, however, pass <em>through</em> an occupied square, provided that the player controlling the obstructing miniature allows you to pass; otherwise you must take another route or stop. Only one miniature can occupy a square.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a character or monster has finished moving, he may fight if he has not already done so. Play then passes to the player on his left.</p>
<img src="rules_move.jpg"></img>
<p>Having rolled a 5, the Elf character finds two of his possible routes blocked by Orcs. The Wizard will let him pass, however.</p>
<h1>Moving around the board</h1>
<p>As the character players move around the gameboard they enter new rooms and passages. If you are the first player to enter a new room or passageway, you should give the evil wizard player enough time to consult the Quest Book map and place onto the board any visible monsters and furniture.</p>
<h2>Opening doors</h2>
<p>Characters and monsters can only enter and leave rooms through open doors. Monsters cannot open doors.</p>
<p>Character players may open a door by moving onto the square in front of it. Character players do not have to open a door if they do not wish to. Opening a door does not count as a move. Having opened a door, a character player may keep moving, if he has any spaces left to move.</p>
<p>As soon as a door is opened, the evil wizard player must place onto the board any pieces shown for that room, or passageway, on the map in the Quest Book. Once opened, a door remains opened for the remainder of the game. The evil wizard player should remove the closed door piece and replace it with an open door piece.</p>
<h2>What can be seen?</h2>
<p>Deciding what can be seen by a player character is very important in determining what should be placed onto the board. Miniatures in the same room are always visible. Miniatures in passages or in different rooms are only visible if you can trace an unobstructed straight line between the two miniatures. If the line passes through a wall or a closed door then the miniature is not visible.</p>
<h2>Blocked Squares</h2>
<p>These tiles should be placed according to the map in the Quest Book as soon as they become visible to a character player. These tiles show where extra walls have been built, or where the ceiling has fallen in. Neither characters or monsters may move through blocked squares.</p>
<h2>Placing Monsters</h2>
<p>Each Quest will usually use more monsters than are available in the game. However, monsters that are eliminated may be used again later in the Quest. If all the monsters of a particular type are on the board and the evil wizard player needs to place another one, he may use any other monster, providing that it is of the same colour as the one that should have been used. This may happen if the character players fail to eliminate the monsters or if they draw too many wandering monster cards from the Treasure card pile.</p>
<h1>Combat</h1>
<p>Combat is split into two stages: attack and defence. The attacker rolls his dice <em>once</em> to score as many skulls as he can. The defender then rolls his dice <em>once</em> to cancel the skulls out by rolling shields.</p>
<h2>Attacking</h2>
<p>To attack a monster or a character, you must be in one of the four squares: to the side, front, or rear. You cannot attack diagonally.</p>
<img src="rules_attack.jpg"></img>
<p><em><b>Example:</b> The Elf may attack from any of the squares where he is shown in the diagram. He may not attack from any of the squares marked "X".</em></p>
<p>To attack, you roll a number of special combat dice (with shields and skulls). The number of dice you roll is shown on your character board or monster card against <em>Attack</em>. For each skull you roll your opponent will lose one Body point, unless he can successfully defend himself. If you fail to roll any skulls the attack is wasted and your opponent need not defend.</p>
<h2>Defending</h2>
<p>To defend, a player rolls the number of special combat dice shown on his character board or monster card against <em>Defend</em>.</p>
<p>The character players must try to roll white shields while the monsters need round, black shields.
Each shield rolled, provided it is the correct type, cancels <em>one</em> skull rolled by the attacker.</p>
<p>Once the result of the defence has been determined, the player who was attacked must reduce his Body point score on his character sheet by one point for every skull for which he failed to roll a shield. When a character’s Body points reach zero, the character is eliminated. Since all monsters only have one Body point, they are eliminated by any roll of a skull for which they fail to roll a round black shield.</p>
<p>Eliminated characters and monsters are immediately removed from play. Any Equipment or gold the eliminated character had may be picked up by another character, who searches for treasure in the room or passage in which the character was eliminated. However, the evil wizard player may also claim the Equipment and gold if, on his <em>next</em> turn he moves a monster into the samé room or passage, in which the character was eliminated.</p>
<p>If a monster picks up the possessions of the eliminated character they are removed from the game, the monster may not use either the Equipment or the gold.</p>
<p>The attacker may now move if he has not already done so. Play then continues with the player on his left.</p>
<h1>The Trial</h1>
<p>You are now ready to play your first Quest. One player must take the role of the evil wizard player. He must read aloud the parchment text for the first adventure in the Quest Book, "The Trial". He should then read through the notes (these are <em>not</em> read aloud to the character players). The game then begins with the player to the left of the evil wizard.</p>
<h1>The Full Game</h1>
<p>Now you have played your first Quest you are ready to learn the rest of the game rules.</p>
<h1>Magic</h1>
<p>There are two characters in the game who may use magic, the Elf and the Wizard. Sort the 12 spell cards into their four sets. There are three cards in each set. Each set corresponds to a different aspect of magical energy: Earth magic, Water magic, Air magic and Fire magic.</p>
<h2>Choosing your Spells</h2>
<p>At the start of each game the Wizard may choose three sets of spells (9 cards) and the Elf may choose one set of spells (3 cards). The Wizard chooses one set of spells first, then the Elf chooses his set, and finally the Wizard takes the remaining two sets.</p>
Image Spell Card Backs
<h2>Casting a Spell</h2>
<p>When it is their turn, the Wizard and the Elf characters have the option of casting a spell <em>instead</em> of attacking. A spell may be cast either before <em>or</em> after moving. You cannot use part of your move, cast a spell and then move again.</p>
<p>Spells can be cast at monsters or characters provided they are visible to the spell-caster. Miniatures in the same room are <em>always</em> visible. Miniatures in passages or in different rooms are only visible if
you can trace an unobstructed straight line between the two miniatures. If the line passes through a wall or a closed door <em>or another miniature</em> then the miniature is <b>not</b> visible.</p>
<p>The spell-caster may always cast a spell on himself. Each spell may be cast just once during the course of each Quest. Once cast, the spell card is discarded.</p>
<h1>Searching</h1>
<p>Characters may also search instead of making an attack or casting a Spell. The search can be made before or after moving. Characters may not search if they are adjacent to a monster or if there is a monster in the same room or passage. Monsters never search.</p>
<p>When a player searches he searches the whole room or passage in which he is standing.</p>
<p>Players must tell the evil wizard player what they are looking for. They may search for either secret doors and traps, or treasure.</p>
<img src="rules_los.jpg"></img>
<p>The evil wizard player then checks the map in the Quest Book to see if there is anything hidden in that particular room or passage. If there is anything to be found, the evil wizard player must reveal it. Searching for secret doors and traps will not reveal treasure, and vice versa.</p>
<h1>Secret doors and traps</h1>
<p>Secret door tiles are only placed on the board if a character player finds them by searching. Trap tiles are only placed if found by a search or if triggered by a character moving onto the trapped square.</p>
<p>Pit traps and falling block traps are placed onto the board when found. Spear traps are rendered harmless when found, so there are no tokens for spear traps. Trap tiles may be removed from the board by any character who has the Tool Kit equipment card and is adjacent to the trap. The Dwarf may automatically remove any trap tile he is adjacent to. He may only remove one trap per turn.</p>
<p>Secret doors may be found by a search on <em>either</em> side of the wall in which they are placed. Once found, secret doors remain open for the rest of the game.</p>
<h1>Traps</h1>
<p>Traps are not put on the board until a character player either searches for traps or moves into a square containing a trap, as shown on the Quest map.</p>
<p>The evil wizard player must tell a character player when he has set a trap off.
The character must stop immediately and can do nothing else until his next turn.</p>
<p>Monsters do not set off traps. They may move freely through squares that contain hidden traps.
Once a trap has been placed onto the board, however, monsters must follow the same rules as characters.</p>
<p>The rules for traps given below are repeated on the inside of the screen for reference.</p>
<h2>Pit Trap</h2>
<p>The pit remains on the board as an obstacle. Any character who stumbles into a pit trap will automatically lose one Body point. Characters in a pit may attack and defend, but roll one less die than normal. They may not search whilst in a pit. The character may move as normal on his next turn.</p>
<h2>Jumping a Pit</h2>
<p>Characters and monsters may attempt to jump across a pit trap. They must have enough movement to get across the pit, counting the pit square as one space. There must be an unoccupied space adjacent to the pit for the miniature to jump onto.</p>
<p>Any miniature who attempts to jump across must roll a combat die. If he rolls a skull he falls into the pit and loses one Body point and may do nothing else until his next turn. Otherwise, the miniature may continue its move.</p>
<h2>Falling Block</h2>
<p>When a character player moves through a square containing a falling block symbol, a block will fall. It will land into the adjacent square marked with the arrow on the Quest map, blocking the way. Any character or monster in the square into which the block falls must roll three combat dice. The victim must lose one Body point for each skull rolled, and then move to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the victim cannot move to an adjacent square, he is eliminated by the falling block.</p>
<h2>Spear Trap</h2>
<p>Any player who triggers a spear trap will lose one Body point if he rolls a Skull on a combat die. The spear trap will <em>only</em> affect the first character to enter the square. Subsequent characters who move through this square will be unaffected.</p>
<h2>Treasure Chest Traps</h2>
<p>Some of the treasure chests contain traps. The effects of these traps are shown in the Quest notes.
If a player searches for traps in a room that contains a trapped treasure chest the trap is found and rendered harmless.</p>
<h1>Treasure</h1>
<p>Some of the Quests provide details about specific treasures which can be found by searching. If a character searches for treasure in the appropriate room the evil wizard player should reveal what treasure is hidden there. If there is no specific treasure listed for that room then the character player must take the top Treasure card.</p>
<p>Monsters may not move treasure chests.</p>
<h2>Treasure cards</h2>
<p>Some of the treasure cards are of gold or jewels. The character player who finds one of these should record the value of the treasure on his character sheet. The card is then discarded. It is <em>not</em> returned to the treasure card pile.</p>
<p>Other treasure cards show traps or wandering monsters. These cards should be read out and the instructions followed immediately. Trap cards and wandering monster cards <em>are</em> returned to the treasure card pile. The treasure card pile is then shuffled before another treasure card is taken.</p>
<h2>Wandering monsters</h2>
<p>Some of the treasure cards do not show treasure at all! Instead they show a ferocious monster. Each Quest in the Quest Book tells the evil wizard player which monster miniature to use when one of these cards is found.</p>
<p>If there is no vacant space adjacent to the character who drew the card, the evil wizard player may place the wandering monster in any vacant square in the same room or passage. In this case he may not, however, attack another character.</p>
<h1>The Quests</h1>
<p>Once you have played through "The Trial" you are ready to undertake the other Quests. These should be played in the order they appear in the Quest Book.</p>
<p>As with "The Trial" each Quest begins with the evil wizard player reading the text in the parchment panel. He should also read through the other notes which detail, for example, where certain special treasures are hidden, how powerful a monster is, and whether there are any special rules that apply to that Quest.</p>
<h2>Setting up a Quest</h2>
<p>Usually the character players start from the room marked with the stairway tile. In some Quests, however, the character players start from a different room. The Quest details will explain what to do in these cases. The contents of the first room (barring any traps, secret doors, or treasure) should be laid out at the beginning of the game.</p>
<h2>Quest treasures</h2>
<p>There are five special Quest treasure cards: the Wand of Recall, the magical sword Orcs Bane,
the Talisman of Lore, Borin's Armour, and the Spirit Blade. <em>Do not mix these cards in with the ordinary treasure cards.</em> They can only be found according to the notes in the Quest Book.</p>
<h2>Completing a Quest</h2>
<p>The character players complete a Quest successfully if they achieve the objectives described in the parchment text which the evil wizard player reads aloud at the beginning of the game. If they fail to do so, or if they are all players (and/or new ones) can always attempt the same Quest again, but the evil wizard player always starts a Quest with a full complement of monsters. Characters escape the dungeon by landing on the stairway tile.</p>
<p><em>Monsters may never land on the stairway tile.</em></p>
<h1>Between Quests</h1>
<p>If your character survives, you may keep him and use him again in subsequent Quests. In this case, you may keep any Quest treasure cards you have found, and you may spend any treasure recorded on your character sheet to purchase better equipment (armour, weapons, and so on). You may <em>not</em> keep ordinary Treasure cards.</p>
<p>The character players may restore their characters' Body and Mind points to their starting value before beginning a new Quest.</p>
<h2>Buying Equipment</h2>
<p>There is a card for each item of equipment available for purchase. Any players wishing to buy equipment should take the card they want, reduce the money on their sheet by the value shown on the card, and make a note of the benefits of the equipment on their sheet. The spear and the staff, for example, allow characters to attack diagonally. A character may not buy equipment if he does not have enough money to do so, but money can be accumulated and kept from Quest to Quest.</p>
<h1>Equipment cards</h1>
<p>These cards improve the characters' abilities. When using a weapon Equipment card the character player rolls the number of dice shown for that weapon, <em>instead</em> of the number of dice shown on his character board against <em>Attack</em>.</p>
<p>The armour Equipment cards are used in the same way. However, some cards like the shield and the helmet cards, allow you to roll an <em>extra</em> die. This is an extra die in addition to those you normally roll. If, for example, you had the chainmail card and the shield card you would roll a total of four combat dice in defence.  You may not wear more than one type of body armour at one time.</p>
<h2>Missile fire</h2>
<p>Some weapons may be thrown, whilst the crossbow may be fited. When firing the crossbow or throwing a weapon the procedure for rolling combat dice in attack and defence remains the same.</p>
<p>Your opponent must be visible, as with casting a spell. There is no maximum range for firing the crossbow or throwing a weapon. However, you may not use the crossbow or throw a weapon if you are adjacent to your opponent.</p>
<h1>Becoming a Champion</h1>
<p>If you use the same character from Quest to Quest you may reach the coveted status of Champion. Each time your character completes a Quest, write the name of the Quest in the box marked Tasks Completed on your character sheet. Once you have completed three Quests, the land's grateful Emperor will make <em>you</em> a Champion.</p>
